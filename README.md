This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

* FinHub is an **addressbook** for insurance agents to manage clients. It helps them to better organise all information related to each client. <br>
  Example usages:
  * Add a client's contact details (eg. number, email)
  * Delete a client's contact 
  * Set reminders for important dates regarding each client
  * View a list of all clients
  * Add Tags to each client 
* The project is an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _FinHub_) used for managing clients' contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[FinHub Product Website](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-f09-1.github.io/tp/index.html)**.
