    UG: Advise Mac users to install a specific JDK
    
    AB3's use JavaFX is known to cause compatibility issues with most Mac
    JDK distributions. In particular, it can cause the UI to show
    garbled text due to font issues.
    
    Let's advise Mac users to use a specific JDK that has built-in JavaFX
    support and has been verified not to cause the aforementioned
    compatibility issues.

    The app shows a log message advising users to ignore the warning message
    about the 'Unsupported JavaFX configuration' at the start.
    
    However, this warning message might not appear under some circumstances.
    In such cases, the advisory message can lead to confusion.

    UserGuide.md: Make JAR download step generic (#28)
    
    Currently, every time a new release is done, developers would have
    to update the file name to reflect the latest JAR file published.
    This can be difficult to keep track of.
    
    Let's change the JAR download step (step 2) in the Quick Start
    section in the user guide to say "latest `.jar` file" instead of
    "latest `addressbook.jar`".
    
    This serves to make the JAR download step generic, eliminating the
    need for developers to update the file name every time a new
    release is published.

    Fix double-space between index and name
    
    The spacing attribute for HBox in PersonListCard.fxml is set to '5',
    causing it to look like a double-space is present in the Person
    List Card (e.g. 1.  John)
    
    Let's reduce the spacing attribute of the HBox in
    PersonListCard.fxml (which determines the spacing between child
    elements) to 0.5, which seems to produce the desired gap, so that
    it looks like a single space is present instead of double
    (e.g. 1. John).

    DG: Split sequence diagram of undo feature
    
    The sequence diagram of the proposed undo feature contains lower
    level detail of two components (i.e., Logic, Model).
    However, we recommend that a UML diagram should not show lower
    level details of more than one component.
    
    Let's split the diagram into two, one showing lower level details
    of Logic, and the other, Model.

    Upgrade JavaFX to ver 17
    
    The application uses JavaFX 11 which is reaching its EOL in September
    2023. Thus it is better to upgrade JavaFX to the next LTS version which
    is version 17.
    
    However, after version 16, JavaFX now throws a warning when JavaFX
    modules are loaded from the classpath. As there is currently no plan to
    migrate to using Modules in AB3, let's include an additional log message
    to inform the users to ignore the warning message.

    PersonCard: remove #equals(object)
    
    This method implements a very weak notion of equivalence, where as long
    as the PersonCard's person and id are equal, the object is equal.
    However, such a weak notion of equivalence goes against the spirit of
    the UI architecture, which states that all UiParts represent a distinct
    part of the UI, and more importantly, wraps a subgraph of the JavaFX
    scene graph (accessible via UiPart#getRoot()). As such, just because two
    PersonCards A and B happen to contain the same ID and person value,
    doesn't mean they are "equal", because they may be holding different
    JavaFX scene graph objects. Any JavaFX-related operations on PersonCard
    A may give a different result to PersonCard B.
    
    Furthermore, this implementation of PersonCard#equals(Object) isn't
    actually used, not even by test code. It was introduced in baa5988d
    (PersonListPanelHandle: Update methods, 2017-07-14) so that one could
    do the following to assert that a certain PersonCard was selected:
    
        private void assertCardSelected(Index index) {
            PersonCard selectedCard = getPersonListPanel().getSelectedCard().get();
            assertEquals(getPersonListPanel().getCard(index.getZeroBased()), selectedCard);
        }
    
    where the assertEquals() would then call PersonCard#equals(Object).
    
    However, since 04a675ff (PersonListPanelHandle: Update
    getSelectedCard(), 2017-07-20) this pattern of code has been (rightly)
    removed, with test code preferring to compare what is actually displayed
    on the PersonCard, rather than using PersonCard#equals(Object):
    
        /**
         * Asserts that {@code actualCard} displays the same values as {@code expectedCard}.
         */
        public static void assertCardEquals(PersonCardHandle expectedCard, PersonCardHandle actualCard) {
            assertEquals(expectedCard.getId(), actualCard.getId());
            assertEquals(expectedCard.getAddress(), actualCard.getAddress());
            assertEquals(expectedCard.getEmail(), actualCard.getEmail());
            assertEquals(expectedCard.getName(), actualCard.getName());
            assertEquals(expectedCard.getPhone(), actualCard.getPhone());
            assertEquals(expectedCard.getTags(), actualCard.getTags());
        }
    
    PersonCard#equals(Object) was, however, not removed then. So let's
    remove it now.

    Remove support for repeated parameters in commands
    
    If a single-valued parameter is repeated multiple times in a command,
    only the last occurrence is taken. This allows the user to correct a
    mistake in a parameter value by simply typing it again, which may be
    faster than moving the cursor back to the original parameter values and
    editing it. This feature serves as a good example of 'going the extra
    mile to optimize the application for target users' (i.e., users who can
    type fast).
    However, this feature can cause certain user errors to go unnoticed
    e.g., unintended repetition caused by a typo in parameter name
    
    Alternatives considered:
    (a) Retain current behavior but give a friendly warning to the user
        that a parameter was 'overridden'.
    (b) Remove this feature i.e., treat repeated single-valued parameters
        as an error, and reject the command with an error message.
    
    Alternative (a) requires significantly more complicated code (see #181),
    steepening the learning curve for for new programmers. Given that this
    application is primarily meant for training novice programmers, the
    impact on the learning curve is not worth the benefit of retaining this
    feature.
    
    Therefore, let's do option (b).

    Fix loggers not following config.json
    
    The current way of initializing loggers causes all loggers to
    default to INFO level, even if a different level is specified
    via the config.json or programmatically.
    
    Let's create a logger named `ab3` to serve as the base logger, and
    automatically prefix all loggers created using LogCenter#getLogger(...)
    with `ab3.` so that they all become descendants of the base logger. This
    allows us to change the level of all loggers simply by changing
    the log level of the base logger (unless those loggers have
    specified their own logging level).
    
    Implications: Loggers not created using the LogCenter#getLogger(...)
    methods will not come under the above control mechanism unless
    their name starts with `ab3.`.

    or ParseException occur.
    
    However, the exceptions might be caused by other issuess like unable to

    Therefore, the current log message is not suitable for CommandException.

    Insufficient permission to write to the data file will show up as

    The application should be able to describe the error to the user rather

    - make the error message more descriptive by informing
    the user that there are insufficient permissions for the file for
    AccesssDeniedExceptions.
    
    - Also include a better general purpose description for other forms
    of IO related exceptions

    Move Messages class into the logic package
    
    The Messages class contains common user-facing messages used by
    commands and parsers in the Logic component.
    
    However, Messages class is in the seedu.address.commons.core
    package that contains classes used system-wide. Given that the
    Messages class is user-facing, it would only ever be used by the
    logic and ui components, and thus would fit better inside the
    seedu.address.logic package.
    
    Furthermore, Messages class accesses classes in the Model component.
    This is not right as the Model component is in a higher layer
    compared to the commons package, as per how the layered
    architecture should work.
    
    Let's move the Messages class to the seedu.address.logic package.

    Rename DataConversionException -> DataLoadingException
    
    DataConversionException is thrown to indicate any problem
    encountered while reading a JSON file, not just problems
    specific to data conversion.
    
    Let's rename it as DataLoadingException to make the name
    more representative of its purpose.

    UniquePersonList: implement toString()
    
    Given that UniquePersonList is meant to be like a "list", let's make its
    string representation the same as Lists, by returning the string
    representation of its internalList.

    Messages: add format(Person) for formatting a Person for display
    
    Commands may sometimes print a user-friendly representation of a person.
    For example, when adding a person, we get:
    
        New person added: John Doe Phone: 12345 Email: john@doe.com Address: Dough Ave Tags:
    
    The user-friendly representation (`John Doe Phone: 12345 Email...`) is
    formatted using Person#toString(). This is not very ideal because it
    means that the model is dealing with user-interface-related concerns,
    which it should not be doing because that is the responsibility of the
    logic and ui layers. Furthermore, using the toString() method for this
    task means that Person#toString() can't be used for more useful
    endeavours such as providing information for debugging purposes.
    
    As such, let's introduce Messages#format(Person) which would be a common
    method for formmating a Person for display to the user, and teach
    commands that need that functionality to use it.

    Adopt a uniform toString() format for value classes
    
    The criteria used for determining which classes to implement the
    standardized toString() methods are:
    
      * Must already implement equals()
    
        This is a strong signal that the classes are "value classes", that
        is, an instance is indistinguishable from another instance as long
        as their states are the same.
    
        Furthermore, these classes would likely be used with
        assertEquals(...) / assertNotEquals(...) in tests. When these
        assertions fail, the toString() representation of the
        expected/actual objects would be printed, and thus developers would
        benefit from the uniform toString() format which allows them to
        compare the state of the objects.
    
        On the other hand, classes which do not implement equals() would
        likely not be used with assertEquals(...) / assertNotEquals(...),
        and thus would not benefit from the uniform toString() format.
    
      * Does not already have its own suitable toString() representation
    
        For example, the toString() representations of Name, Phone, Email,
        Address, Tag are suitable enough for them, as they already convey
        the object's state, and thus would not benefit from the uniform
        toString() format. These classes are also only designed to contain
        one piece of information (e.g. for the Name class, a name, and for
        the Email class, an email), and thus would not benefit from the
        standardized toString() format which is designed for multiple pieces
        of information.

    Fix Jekyll server crash on newer versions of Ruby (#185)
    
    Running `bundle exec jekyll serve` (to view the application's
    documentation locally) crashes due to a compatibility issue
    with Jekyll 3 and Ruby >=3.0.
    Specifically, this is because gem webrick is no longer
    bundled by default in Ruby 3.0
    
    Let's resolve this by,
    - adding webrick to the Gemfile
    - updating the relevant dependencies in Gemfile.lock

    Add a null check to LogCenter.getLogger(Class<T>)
    
    LogCenter.getLogger(Class<T> clazz) creates a Logger named
    after the given class. If the clazz is null, it is supposed to
    create a Logger with an empty String as the name.
    
    The current implementation calls Logger.getLogger("")
    instead of LogCenter.getLogger(""), which results in the Logger
    object not having the handlers that are added inside the
    LogCenter.getLogger(String) method. This means log messages
    written using such a logger will not appear in the log files.
    
    However, the current codebase has no use case for passing a
    null object to this method. As per the YAGNI principle,
    we should not implement that ability until we actually need it.
    
    Hence, instead of correcting the said error, let's add an assertion
    to ensure null is never passed to this method, eliminating the need
    for the buggy code path in the first place.

    Upgrade Codecov GitHub Action to v2 (#128)
    
    Codecov GitHub Action v1 uses a deprecated bash uploader, which may
    cease to function soon. The v2 version also has a files arg instead of a
    file arg, suggesting possible deprecation of the file arg.
    
    Let's upgrade to v2, use the files arg for coverage.xml and the directory
    arg for the directory in which coverage.xml is found.

    at sidestepping se-edu/addressbook-level3#105. A better solution has been
    identified which made the current fix redundant while introducing path issues
    that are not obvious, see se-edu/addressbook-level3#111 for more details.

    Model class diagram: show 'filtered list' as an association role (#64)
    
    The model class diagram shows 'filtered list' as an association label
    when it should be shown as an association role instead.
    
    Let's correct that error. A longer arrow is used to get an optimal
    layout for the diagram.

    Omit the top navigation menu when a page is printed
    
    When a page in the product website (e.g, the User Guide) is converted
    into a print view, the top navigation bar appears in printed version.
    This is not appropriate as a navigation bar belongs in a Web page but
    not in a printed view. This is particularly a problem when documents
    in the website are converted into PDF, which is done by 'printing' the
    page into a PDF file.
    
    Let's update the behaviour of the media print query to replace the top
    navigation menu with simply the project name.

    Prevent page breaks cutting through content when converting to PDF (#76)
    
    Converting documents to PDF causes page breaks to cut through content.
    
    As the PDF conversion is achieved by printing the Web page to a PDF,
    let's specify the behaviour of the media print query to change the
    display type of the 'body' component to 'block', which fixes this issue.

    Update isSamePerson() equality for Person class
    
    The person equality check returns true if the name or the email
    matches. The OR condition complicates the equality check done when
    editing a person as it assumes isSamePerson() to have a transitive
    relation.
    
    Alternative 1: Improve the way the equality check is done in the edit
    command to prevent the above bug. (PRs #68, #69)
    
    Alternative 2: Simplify the equality check by removing the OR condition.
    This is simpler but possibly too strict for the address book domain
    i.e., increases the risk of duplicate entries for the same person
    creeping into the address book
    
    We decided to go with the alternative 2 because,
    * It is important to keep the code base simple, to reduce the initial
    learning curve of the students at the start of their project
    * Students can introduce a more sophisticated equality check that
    matches their product domain later.
    
    Also, let's change the default name in PersonBuilder utility class.
    This is because AddCommandIntegrationTest populates its model using
    getTypicalPersons() which contains a person with the default name.
    This test then creates another person using the default name, to be
    added into the model, which is expected to pass. However, the above
    update in equality causes this test to fail. Thus we need to change the
    default name to a unique name that is not inside getTypicalPersons().
    Also, the default email is changed for consistency in naming the
    default values, it does not affect current test cases.

    Update Checkout action default branch
    
    GitHub Actions gives a warning that the checkout action no longer has
    'master' as the default branch. This is because the checkout actions
    repo itself has renamed its default branch from 'master' to 'main'.
    
    The action may eventually break when the 'master' branch option is
    no longer supported.
    
    Let's update the CI workflow to use actions/checkout@main instead of
    actions/checkout@master, to fix the warning.

    CommandBox: update handleCommandEntered() for empty strings
    
    CommandBox passes empty string to Logic for parsing and execution.
    An empty string is unsuccessfully parsed, resulting in an error message
    stating "Invalid command format" being displayed to the user.
    
    This behaviour seems unintuitive, as it is unlikely that users expect
    an empty string to be able to execute a correct command.
    
    Let's teach CommandBox to perform nothing when there is no user input
    and the enter button is pressed.

    Migrate to Jekyll, GitHub Actions
    
    This project uses AsciiDoc for doucmentation. The courses that use
    this project no longer needs section numbering and content inclusion
    features in documentation. That opens the door for going back to
    Markdown, which is more widely used and simpler.
    
    This project also uses Travis/AppVeyor for CI.
    With the recent release of GitHub Actions, there is no need to depend
    on external CI services.
    
    Let's do the following changes:
    * Migrate documentation from AsciiDoc to Markdown, and use Jekyll to
      generate the project website. The migration was done mostly by
      @j-lum, with minor cosmetic/content tweaks added by @damithc
    * Migrate to GitHub Actions (from Travis and AppVeyor).
    
    As a side-effect, we have to drop support for Coveralls,
    because the current Coveralls set up depends on Travis.
    We expect to bring back Coverall support in future.
    
    We decided to do both major changes at the same time in order to
    avoid some overlaps, and also snuck in some documentation tweaks
    because almost every documentation line is touched by the
    asciidoc to Markdown conversion anyway.

    Disable the resizability and the maximize button completely as it serves
    no purpose.
    
    Remove unnecessary call to sizeToScene() as HelpWindow defaults to
    USE_COMPUTED_SIZE and the computed size of all its children nodes are
    available before it is shown.
    
    Remove TODO in HelpWindow.fxml as the initial size is set to computed
    size.

    Feedback from previous students indicated that they have some problem
    grokking the code base. Let's address this by having a simple tutorial
    where students learn how to apply the tools at hand to trace the
    execution flow of code.

    Remove dependencies on WebView
    
    The HelpWindow is the only component that relies on WebView, a
    dependency that weighs in at around 70MB, more than quadrupling the size
    of the executable jar. As there are plans to customize the jars for each
    individual student during the practical examination, this overhead can
    lead to further problems (bandwidth in the lecture hall, storage space,
    etc).
    
    Let's remove the dependency on WebView by changing HelpWindow to display
    a link to the user guide instead.

    Migrate to PlantUML from PowerPoint
    
    PlantUML is a mature, specialized tool to generate UML diagrams. As it
    is avtext-based markup language, it works very well with git (e.g.
    produces easy to grok diffs).Moreover, it is an open-source tool which
    does not require students to obtain proprietary, paid software to use.
    
    Based on these advantages that PlantUML offer over PowerPoint, let's
    adopt PlantUML as the tool of choice to generate UML diagrams.
    
    Introduce a tutorial to help students understand the basics of PlantUML
    and how its used in AddressBook to generate diagrams.
    
    Replace .pptx diagram templates with .puml files.
    
    Replace instances of pptx generated diagrams with puml diagrams.

    Replace all references to AB3.5 with AB3
    
    The AB-3.5 repo is now ready to become the new AB-3. Compared to the old
    AB-3, the AB-3.5 codebase is derived from the AB-4 codebase, and thus
    shares all of its improvements, and allows us to more easily port over
    changes from AB-4.
    
    To allow the replacement to happen, let's replace all references to
    AB-3.5 with AB-3.
    
    This is done by grepping the codebase for:
    
     * `Level 3\.5`
     * `level35`
     * `AB3\.5`
     * `AB-3\.5`
     * `\b3\.5\b`
    
    After this conversion, the old `se-edu/addressbook-level3` repo on
    GitHub should be renamed to something else, while the
    `se-edu/addressbook-level35` repo on GitHub (this repo) should be
    renamed to `se-edu/addressbook-level3`.

    template header: replace AB-3's nav item with AB-3.5
    
    As AB-3.5 was derived from the AB-4 codebase, it is currently occupying
    AB-4's position in the site navigation bar.
    
    However, AB-3.5 is not meant to replace AB-4, but to replace AB-3 in the
    future.
    
    As such, let's modify the site navigation bar such that AB-3.5 replaces
    AB-3, and restore AB-4's navigation item. This sets up the site
    navigation bar nicely for AB-3.5 to take over AB-3 in the future.

    docs: tell readers that the screenshots are meant for AB-4
    
    As the AB-3.5 repo inherited all of AB-4's documentation, it also
    inherited their screenshots as well. However, these screenshots refer to
    `addressbook-level4`, for use with the AB-4 repo, instead of
    `addressbook-level35` which should be used with the AB-3.5 repo.
    
    As such, let's add a note at the top of these documents informing
    readers of this fact.
    
    Yes, this means that readers would have to mentally replace all
    references to `addressbook-level4` in the screenshots with
    `addressbook-level35`, which could potentially confuse them. Ideally,
    these screenshots should be modified to refer to `addressbook-level35`,
    and the note should be added to the AB-4 repo instead. This is because
    AB3.5 comes chronologically before AB-4, and readers would likely
    encounter the documents in the AB-3.5 repo first and benefit most from
    having clear unambiguous screenshots.
    
    However, now is not a good time to update all the screenshots as the
    AB-3.5 repo is still in flux. As such, let's settle for the note first,
    with a plan to update the screenshots in the future.

    The LO still refers to the names of the old classes (`Logic`, which was
    renamed to `LogicManager`, and `Parser`, which was renamed to
    `AddressBookParser`). Update them to the new names.
    
    Also, this LO refers to the old LO-DIP, which had an exercise on
    applying DIP to the `Logic` class by modifying its design.  However, in
    the current codebase, DIP has already been applied to the design of the
    `LogicManager` class, and LO-DIP was updated in b8950fb5 (LO-DIP: update
    to match the current codebase, 2019-06-11) to account for that by
    replacing the exercise with a statement on how the current design is
    already an application of DIP. Let's update LO-OCP in a similar manner.

    LO-DI: update to match the current codebase
    
    The LO refers to changing the implementation of the `Logic` (now
    `LogicManager`) class so that it depends on the abstract class `Storage`
    instead of the concrete class `StorageFile` (now `StorageManager`).
    
    However, in the current codebase, the `LogicManager` class already
    depends on the interface `Storage`, so students would not need to do the
    above anymore. Update the LO and its diagrams to take this into account.
    
    The other part of the exercise (implementing a `StorageStub` class) is
    still applicable.
    
    While we are updating the diagrams, also update the colors used so that
    it matches the class diagrams in the developer guide.

    In the current codebase, the `LogicManager` class already depends on the

    current codebase -- we remove the exercise, and replace it with a
    statement on how the current design is an application of DIP.
    
    While we are here, update the colors used in the diagram to match the

    its filename better matches its contents.

    single responsibility principle in the current codebase -- the use of a
    separate ParserUtil class for handling the parsing of model data.
    
    While we are here, let's add some explanatory comments to make it clear
    what the division of responsibilities between the model/parser layers
    are.

    LO-Interfaces: update to match the current codebase
    
    LO-Interfaces references ReadOnlyPerson, which was removed in 345d05f6
    (Remove ReadOnlyPerson, 2018-01-10).
    
    Update it to the current codebase by replacing it with
    AddressBook/ReadOnlyAddressBook. Conveniently, it also does the whole
    "clients who don't need write access to Foo can use ReadOnlyFoo" thing,
    so the LO text doesn't need to change much.
    
    However, unlike ReadOnlyPerson, the UI in the current codebase doesn't
    depend on ReadOnlyAddressBook, since it is not concerned with the
    address book at a whole, but rather its individual components (e.g. the
    person list) which are forwarded individually by the logic layer. Only
    the Storage and Logic layers are interested in ReadOnlyAddressBook. As
    such, let's replace "MainWindow" in the diagram with "StorageManager" so
    it matches the current code.
    
    (While we are here, also update the gradients/colors used in the diagram
    to match the ones used in the developer guide class diagrams.)

    Import the original AB-3 LearningOutcomes
    
    As we are planning to replace AB-3 with this repo, let's import the
    original AB-3 Learning Outcomes document and diagrams from the AB-3 repo
    (as of commit 841298aa618dbffe710469639ed922c27752cd36).
    
    For now, we will import the document as-is, even though the source code
    in this repo has some differences compared to the original AB-3, and so
    some of the Learning Outcomes exercises can't be directly applied. We
    will update the Learning Outcomes document incrementally in later PRs.
    
    The original authors of the Learning Outcomes document are listed below
    (in alphabetical order):

    diagrams: rename .pptx files to match their .png files
    
    Some of the pptx files in the `docs/diagrams/` directory do not have the
    same base filename as their corresponding PNG files in the
    `docs/images/` directory. For example, the corresponding PNG file for
    `docs/diagrams/HighLevelSequenceDiagrams.pptx` is
    `docs/images/SDforDeletePerson.png`.
    
    Such inconsistent naming can confuse developers when updating the
    diagrams. This unfortunately already happened before in 5509159e
    (diagrams: restore original LogicComponentSequenceDiagram.pptx,
    2019-02-27).
    
    As such, let's rename the pptx files so that their filenames match their
    corresponding PNG files. For example, we rename
    `docs/diagrams/HighLevelSequenceDiagrams.pptx` to
    `docs/diagrams/SDforDeletePerson.pptx` so that it matches
    `docs/images/SDforDeletePerson.png`.

    .gitignore: standardize and specify entries
    
    We ignore files traced by git by adding entries in .gitignore.
    
    The format of the entries are not standardized and some of entries are
    too general so git will also ignore other files with same name, which
    is an unwanted behavior.
    
    We should only ignore files which the project strictly requires to be
    ignored. Let's standardize and specify entries the entries in
    .gitignore to solve the problem. The entries are reordered by their
    category. Some unnecessary entries are removed and some general entries
    are specified.

    Upgrade to JDK 11
    
    We currently advertise that we support "JDK 8". However, the public
    updates of Java SE 8 for personal users will end soon [1].
    
    JDK 11 is the next Long-Term-Support (LTS) release after JDK 8 [1].
    It is better for us to keep updated with the latest release of JDK.
    
    Let's update our target JDK to version 11, with the following steps:
    
      * We use openjfx-monocle version jdk-11+26 since that is the latest
        version of openjfx-monocle that supports JDK 11 [2].
    
      * We bump the target and source compatibility of Gradle to JDK11.
    
      * We update Travis and AppVeyor configs to use JDK11 as runtime
        environment.
    
      * We remove the add-on in Travis config because it is redundant for
        JDK 11 [3].
    
      * We make it clear in the User Guide / Developer Guide that we only
        support JDK 11 and above (not JDK 8, 9, 10).

    Workaround coveralls upload failure on Travis CI
    
    Our Travis CI builds are configured to run the Gradle `coveralls` task
    to upload test coverage information to coveralls.io.
    
    However, when our Travis CI builds are also configured to use JDK 11,
    the following error occurs when running the `coveralls` task:
    
        > Task :coveralls FAILED
        service name: travis-ci
        service job id: 520624518
        repo token: null
    
        FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
    
        * What went wrong:
        Execution failed for task ':coveralls'.
        > javax.net.ssl.SSLProtocolException: Connection reset by peer (Write failed)
    
    This is because JDK 11 implements support for TLS v1.3 [1], and will
    attempt to use it if the server also supports it (coveralls.io does).
    However, a bug [2] in its TLS v1.3 implementation causes it to send
    invalid data to coveralls.io. When coveralls.io receives this invalid
    data, it terminates the connection, hence the error occurs.
    
    Let's workaround this problem by disabling TLS v1.3 support in the JDK.
    This workaround should be fine for now, since not many servers support
    TLS v1.3 yet as the TLS v1.3 spec was only published on Aug 2018 [3].
    Furthermore, JDK developers have already acknowledged the bug [2] and
    targeted its fix for JDK 13 (i.e. in the near future).

    Workaround headless test failure on Windows OS
    
    For headless test task, 'prism.order' property is used to choose the
    graph renderer to use. Currently, we specify this property to be 'sw'.
    
    However, this property triggers a bug of openjdk-jfx with headless
    mode [1]. This property will cause Java Runtime Error for Windows OS
    including AppVeyor:
    
        # A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
        #
        #  EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=0x00007ffd95b64879, pid=1476, tid=2640
        #
        # JRE version: OpenJDK Runtime Environment (11.0.1+13) (build 11.0.1+13)
        # Java VM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (11.0.1+13, mixed mode, tiered, compressed oops, g1 gc, windows-amd64)
        # Problematic frame:
        # C  [javafx_font.dll+0x4879]
    
    This bug has been identified and will be fixed in future release [2].
    There is a workaround suggested which adds static initialization
    blocks to load required library before any FxToolkit code [3].
    
    Java will initialize base classes first before classes of instance
    members [4] [5]. For all GUI tests, they uses GuiUnitTest or
    AddressBookSystemTest as their base class. Let's add the static
    initialization blocks to these two classes to solve the problem.

    build.gradle: add javafx runtime dependency for all platforms
    
    We have added the platform-specific javafx runtime dependencies, so the
    addressbook is able to run locally.
    
    However, the jar file generated on one OS cannot run on other OS. The
    reason is that, after detecting the OS, javafx will try to load
    platform-specific classes dynamically. Without corresponding javafx
    dependencies for that other OS, the class loading process will fail.
    
    Let's add the javafx runtime dependency for all platforms (MacOS,
    Window, Linux) so the jar file generated on one OS is able to run in
    other OS [1].
    
    Following are some key facts that guarantee the solution to work:
    
      * Gradle places all dependency JARs on the classpath and the order is
        not defined by Gradle.
    
      * When shadowJar encounters duplicate classes with same package name
        and same class name, it picks the first one it sees. ShadowJar
        processes dependency JARs according to their order in classpath.
    
      * The platform-specific JARs for different OSs can define the same
        classes. (e.g. javafx-graphics-11-win.jar and
        javafx-graphics-11-linux.jar both contain
        javafx/scene/control/TreeView.class). However, via diffing the
        contents of the JARs, we have verified that if two JARs define the
        same class, the class files are also identical to each other. So, it
        doesn't matter if the TreeView.class from javafx-graphics-11-win.jar
        or the TreeView.class from javafx-graphics-11-linux.jar is loaded.
        As such, no matter what order Gradle places JavaFX's JARs on the
        classpath, we can run and distribute addressbook properly.

    Change the entry point of addressbook
    
    After adding the javafx runtime dependency, addressbook is still unable
    to run in a JDK11 environment. It gives an error of below:
    
        Error: JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application
    
    This error comes from sun.launcher.LauncherHelper in the java.base
    module. The reason for this is that the MainApp extends Application
    and has a main method. If that is the case, the LauncherHelper will
    check for the javafx.graphics module to be present as a named module.
    If that module is not present, the launch is aborted. Hence, having
    the JavaFX libraries as jars on the classpath is not allowed in this
    case [1].
    
    This is more like a JDK 11 problem which cannot be solved elegantly.
    One simple workaround is to have a separate main class that doesn't
    extend Application. Hence it doesn't do the check on javafx.graphics
    module, and when the required jars are on the classpath, it works fine.
    
    Let's add another main class to be the new entry point of addressbook
    to solve this problem [2].

    JavaFX is not distributed with Oracle JDK any more from JDK11
    onwards [1]. Our code uses javafx as our client platform. So it is
    unable to be compiled in JDK11 anymore.
    
    As we are moving to JDK11, let's add javafx runtime dependencies to
    gradle.
    
    Meanwhile, the dependencies provided are platform specific. Let's use

    external dependencies used for the build script [3].

    Build.gradle: Remove JUnit 4 libraries
    
    Currently, we use a mix of both JUnit 4 and 5 libraries, using JUnit
    Vintage to maintain compatibility with JUnit 4 tests.
    
    After migrating all tests to JUnit 5, we no longer need these
    libraries to support JUnit 4. Hence, we can remove these libraries
    from build.gradle to reduce the number of unncessary components, thus
    streamlining our codebase.
    
    Let's remove JUnit 4 test and support libraries from build.gradle.

    Checkstyle: Remove exceptions for JUnit 4 annotations
    
    Checkstyle contains exceptions to allow certain exceptions in coding
    style for JUnit 4 tests. For example, Checkstyle allows declaration of
    a public variable if it is preceded by a Rule tag so as to ensure
    correct variable assignment by JUnit 4.
    
    After migrating all tests to JUnit 5, we no longer need these
    exceptions for annotations specific to JUnit 4. Hence, we can remove
    these annotations to tighten our strictness on coding style.
    
    Hence, let's remove exceptions in checkstyle for JUnit 4 annotations.
    Notably, let's remove
    * Before/BeforeClass/After/AfterClass tags used to denote functions to
    run before/after a test
    * Rule/ClassRule tags used to denote rules (now extensions in JUnit 5)

    ClockRule: Migrate to ClockExtension
    
    We use ClockRule to implement a clock for unit testing.
    
    Rules are part of JUnit 4, and have been replaced by extensions in
    JUnit 5. As we migrate to JUnit 5, we should update ClockRule to
    follow the new naming convenion and use JUnit 5 extension style.
    
    Let's rewrite ClockRule to implement an injectable clock using JUnit5
    callbacks.
    
    With a ClockExtension now migrated to JUnit 5 API, we need to update
    AddressBookSystemTest to use the JUnit 5 runner too, so that the
    ClockExtension can be activated. As a result, all system tests that
    extend from AddressBookSystemTest also need to be updated to use the
    JUnit 5 runner.
    Migration to the JUnit 5 runner means that we also need to update
    other API changes such as:
    * Before/BeforeClass becomes BeforeEach/BeforeAll
    * After/AfterClass becomes AfterEach/AfterAll
    * Rules are no longer supported, extensions are registed with
    RegisterExtension instead.

    UiTest: Migrate StageRule to StageExtension and UiPartRule to UiPartExtension
    
    We use JUnit 4 style tests in the UI segment of unit tests.
    JUnit 5 offers a more declarative and extension-based unit test, to
    encourage reuse of components common to all tests.
    
    As we migrate towards JUnit 5, it is essential that we migrate the UI
    unit tests to adopt JUnit 5's style. Most importantly, JUnit 5
    replaces Rules with Extensions, hence we need to migrate UiPartRule to
    UiPartExtension and StageRule to StageExtension.
    
    Let's replace UiPartRule with UiPartExtension, and StageRule with
    StageExtension, taking advantage of JUnit 5's extensive hook interface
    (BeforeEachCallback and AfterEachCallback) to simplify our
    implementation of hooks. Notably, we no longer need to implement our
    own before/hook/after sequence.
    
    However, this migration introduces a complication. As extensions are
    specific to JUnit 5, we cannot use extensions without switching the
    test runner to JUnit 5's Jupiter test runner. However, this switch
    means that we also need to migrate other API changes.
    Notably,
    * Before/BeforeClass becomes BeforeEach/BeforeAll
    * After/AfterClass becomes AfterEach/AfterAll
    
    Furthermore, HelpWindowTest needs to continue skipping the test in
    headless mode, due to a bug (still yet to be fixed) in JavaFX. The
    equivalent API in JUnit 5 is located in
    org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions.*, so in order to continue skipping
    the test, we need to migrate the call and update its method signature
    as necessary.

    TemporaryFolder: Migrate to JUnit 5 TempDir API
    
    We use JUnit 4's TemporaryFolder rule to initialise a temporary
    folder.
    
    Rules are no longer supported by JUnit 5 test runners. In addition,
    JUnit 5.4.0 introduces the TempDir extension that supersedes the
    TemporaryFolder rule.
    
    Let's migrate our usage of TemporaryFolder rules to TempDir.
    
    As TempDirs in JUnit 5 are Paths, it is no longer necessary to invoke
    methods like getRoot().toPath() on the TempDir. Additionally, the way
    to get a URL resource from the TempDir is also different from
    TemporaryFolder. The relevant methods have been updated.
    
    In LogicManagerTest and MainWindowCloseTest, the newFile() API is not
    supported by JUnit 5's TempDir. However, as the random file name
    provided by newFile() is not necessary (we have full control over the
    contents of the temporary directory), instead of re-implementing
    newFile() to match the behavior of existing tests, we explicitly give
    the file names and use Path.resolve() instead.

    JUnit: Migrate to use JUnit 5 test runner
    
    We use JUnit 4 test runner (org.junit.Test) to execute our unit and
    system testing.
    
    To use new features such as callbacks, extensions and temporary
    directories in JUnit 5, we need to use the new JUnit 5 test runner.
    
    Let's
    * use the new org.junit.jupiter.api.Test instead of org.junit.Test
    * use BeforeEach instead of Before
    * use BeforeAll instead of BeforeClass
    * use AfterEach instead of After
    * use AfterAll instead of AfterClass
    
    Note: Tests that involve TemporaryFolders, JavaFX, UiPartRule,
    StageRule and ClockRule will be migrated in another commit, so as
    to limit the scope of each commit.

    JUnit: Upgrade to JUnit 5.4.0
    
    We write our tests using the JUnit 5.1.0 API. The JUnit 5.1.0 API
    contains most features we require, such as assertTrue or assertThrows.
    
    We have unit tests such as StorageManagerTest#prefsReadSave that
    require writing to the filesystem. These tests need to make use of
    temporary directories. This is so that
    (1) we can begin with a clean, known state at the start of each test
    and
    (2) we can prevent our test output from polluting the user's file
    system.
    
    However, JUnit 5.1.0 does not support creating temporary directories
    natively, so developers need to create a custom TemporaryDirectory
    implementation or rely on JUnit-Pioneer library [1]. Both of these
    solutions make it complicated to implement and for future developers
    to understand.
    
    JUnit 5.4.0 is the first version of JUnit that has a native temporary
    directory API [2]. By upgrading to JUnit 5.4.0, we can directly use
    the org.junit.jupiter.api.io.TempDir API.
    This reduces the complexity of implementing a temporary directory.
    
    Let's upgrade to use JUnit 5.4.0.

    JUnit Assert: Migrate to JUnit 5 API
    
    We use JUnit 4's Assert API. For example, in most classes, we import
    org.junit.Assert.assertFalse or org.junit.Assert.assertEquals.
    
    In JUnit 5, the API has migrated to
    org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*. While the functionality remains
    largely similar, JUnit 4 APIs are no longer supported by the JUnit 5
    runner (unless a legacy Vintage engine is used [1]). Thus, it is
    necessary to use JUnit 5 APIs as we migrate our tests to JUnit 5.
    
    Let's migrate our API calls to assertion statements to use the
    ones provided by JUnit 5 instead.
    This can be done by changing all references of org.junit.Assert.* to
    org.junit.jupiter.Assertions.*.
    
    In this migration, some methods signatures such as assertTrue(String,
    Boolean) has been changed to assertTrue(Boolean, String). The relevant
    method calls have been updated to reflect this signature change.

    Assert: Use JUnit 5 Assert#assertThrows
    
    Assert contains a custom assertThrows method.
    
    This implementation was done when we used JUnit 4 which has no proper
    support for assertThrows. This is now unnecessary as JUnit 5's
    Assertions.assertThrows performs the same functionality.
    
    Let's replace Assert#assertThrows with JUnit 5's assertThrows.
    
    With this change, VoidCallable becomes redundant as its behaviour
    is replicated with JUnit 5's Executable interface.
    
    Let's remove it.

    CheckStyle: Allow exceptions for JUnit 5 test annotations
    
    We use CheckStyle to check and uphold some of our coding standards.
    While CheckStyle works properly for majority of our code, some test
    APIs work differently. For example, it is necessary to declare public
    variables in the case of:
    @Rule
    public TemporaryFolder testFolder = new TemporaryFolder();
    To suppress CheckStyle warnings for these "poor" coding practice, we
    allow exceptions when we detect certain annotations. For example,
    anything immediately succeeding a @Rule tag can be declared as public.
    
    As we migrate to JUnit 5, we need to add exceptions for the equivalent
    test annotations used in JUnit 5 [1]. For example, BeforeClass is now
    BeforeAll. JUnit 5 also introduces new annotations such as the TempDir
    and RegisterExtension annotation.
    
    Hence, let's
    * add JUnit 5 annotations such as BeforeAll/BeforeEach to
    allowedAnnotations in Javadoc module
    * add TempDir and RegisterExtension annotation to
    ignoreAnnotationCanonicalNames in VisibilityModifier module.
    
    Keeping in mind that some tests are still written in JUnit 4 style
    during this transition phase, when adding the TempDir and
    RegisterExtension annotations, we cannot remove exceptions for
    existing annotations (such as Rule and ClassRule). Hence, in the
    VisibilityModifier module, when we override the default value to add
    TempDir and RegisterExtension, we also need to add Rule and ClassRule
    tags which are in use by existing code [2].
    
    [1] As of March 2019,
    http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_javadoc.html#JavadocMethod
    does not have JUnit 5 annotations.
    [2] Default modifiers are Rule, ClassRule and VisibleForTesting.

    build.gradle: Remove TestFX-JUnit dependency
    
    We include the TestFX-JUnit dependency in our build.gradle since [1].
    However, we also implement our own StageRule and SystemTestSetupHelper
    to setup the UI environment for unit tests and system tests
    respectively. These classes replicate TestFX-JUnit's ApplicationTest
    behavior [2], so our tests do not need to extend from ApplicationTest.
    
    According to TestFX's documentation [3], TestFX-JUnit provides the
    ApplicationTest class that we can inherit from. Since we already
    implement the necessary setup routine, we do not need to inherit from
    ApplicationTest. TestFX-JUnit thus adds no value to our project now.

    Tests: standardize the way we check for thrown exceptions (#1007)
    
    We have many different ways of checking for thrown exceptions. These are
    not standardized, and make it difficult for a reader because they have
    to learn the different ways of throwing exceptions.
    
    Let's standardize the way we test exception throwing behavior,
    specifically towards using Assert#assertThrows.

    Thrown exception checking: Migrate to use AssertThrows
    
    We use a mix of 4 different ways to test exception throwing. We use:
    * try/catch - catch and ensure we receive the correct exception.
    * Assert#assertThrows
    * JUnit#assertThrows
    * JUnit#ExpectedException.
    All these methods semantically do the same thing.
    
    To streamline and standardise our code, we should only use one way to
    check for thrown exceptions. Rationale: developers only need to learn
    one style of implementation.
    
    The try/catch method is implemented differently in each file that
    requires it and causes unnecessary code duplication. The assertThrows
    style, in comparison, provides a shorter syntax and is easier to read
    as compared to the ExpectedException style or the try/catch style.
    We should thus aim to use the assertThrows style.
    
    In Assert.java, we implement custom methods that provide additional
    functionality such as testing for correctness of error messages shown
    to users. With Assert#assertThrows providing a superset of
    functionality as compared to all other ways, it makes sense to use
    Assert#assertThrows as the standardised way to test for thrown
    exceptions.
    
    Let's convert all our exception checking to use Assert#assertThrows.
    
    In doing so, some tests no longer need to declare to throw exceptions.
    
    Let's clean up our code to remove these unnecessary declarations.
    
    Additionally, two more classes - StringUtilTest and IndexTest -
    implement methods to encapsulate the idea of checking for thrown
    exceptions. Now that we can directly call Assert#assertThrows, these
    abstractions provide little benefit.
    
    Let's remove them to simplify our code base.

    LogicManagerTest: Split assertCommandBehavior into assertCommandSuccess and assertCommandFailure
    
    When given an exception, assertCommandBehavior ensures that the
    correct exception is thrown. When given null, assertCommandBehavior
    ensures that no exception is thrown. While the function cleverly
    avoids the use of if/else statements, it is difficult for a reader to
    understand the flow of assertCommandBehavior. It is also responsible
    for two distinct tasks and violates the single responsibility
    principle. Additionally, assertCommandBehavior is not descriptive -
    what behaviour are we assuring ourselves?
    
    When assertCommandBehavior was first introduced, no documentation was
    made on the design choice. It is likely that this was implemented
    because JUnit did not provide an API to check for thrown exceptions.
    With a single method able to check for both exceptions and its lack
    thereof, it made sense to implement assertCommandBehavior to reduce
    code repetition.
    
    Now, with Assert#assertThrows, the call to checking for thrown
    exceptions is just one line. The cost in difficulty in understanding
    how assertCommandBehavior works and its violation of Single
    Responsibility Principle now outweighs the benefits of the reduced
    code repetition.
    
    Let's separate assertCommandBehavior into assertCommandSuccess and
    assertCommandFailure instead, to make our code easier to understand
    and more in line with the Single Responsibility Principle.

    Standardize Assert#assertThrows(...) calls to use static import
    
    We use a mixture of calling the static
    Assert.assertThrows(...) and calling a statically imported
    Assert#assertThrows.
    
    This can make it confusing for readers, as we have 2 different ways of
    calling the same assertThrows.
    
    Let's standardise, across all tests, to use a statically imported
    Assert#assertThrows. This also has the benefit of making our code less
    verbose and easier to read.

    TestApp: Remove null supplier for initialDataSupplier
    
    InitialDataSupplier defaults to a null supplier `() -> null`.
    
    This is redundant as initialDataSupplier is initialised by the
    constructor.

    TestApp: Change visibility of initialDataSupplier to private
    
    Currently, initialDataSupplier is a protected variable. However, it is
    used only within TestApp. Hence, initialDataSupplier can be made
    private.
    
    This improves abstraction by hiding more details of TestApp from other
    classes.
    
    Let's teach TestApp to make initialDataSupplier private.

    TestApp: Move DEFAULT_PREF_LOCATION_FOR_TESTING into AddressBookSystemTest
    
    The location for the preference file is fixed within TestApp as a
    constant. TestApp#initConfig overrides MainApp#initConfig, so when the
    TestApp starts, the preferences file is always initialised to a fixed
    file. This reduces the flexibility for testing.
    
    In contrast, the saveFileLocation is a variable that is set by classes
    that initialise TestApp, such as AddressBookSystemTest. The
    saveFileLocation can be easily mocked and tested, as compared to the
    fixed prefFileLocation. Even though we currently have no tests that
    use a custom prefFileLocation, having one increases our flexibility
    in testing as we can simply write classes similar to (or extending)
    AddressBookSystemTest to supply a custom prefFileLocation.
    
    Let's move DEFAULT_PREF_LOCATION_FOR_TESTING into
    AddressBookSystemTest.
    
    As a result, the name of the constant changes - it is no longer a
    "default" preference location. This brings the variable name in line
    with SAVE_LOCATION_FOR_TESTING.
    Furthermore, TestApp now needs to be initialised with the value of
    prefFileLocation. The relevant method calls have been updated to
    supply a prefFileLocation.

    TestApp: Move SAVE_LOCATION_FOR_TESTING into AddressBookSystemTest
    
    TestApp has a constant SAVE_LOCATION_FOR_TESTING.
    SAVE_LOCATION_FOR_TESTING is used only within
    AddressBookSystemTest#getDataFileLocation. In fact,
    AddressBookSystemTest retrieves the value of
    SAVE_LOCATION_FOR_TESTING, then passes it into
    SetupHelper#setupApplication, which then invokes TestApp to initialise
    the saveFileLocation parameter. AddressBookSystemTest essentially
    violates the tell-don't-ask principle, as it retrieves the constant
    and later makes TestApp set that value. Since AddressBookSystemTest is
    responsible for initialising TestApp with these constants (in fact it
    is the only class using these constants), moving the constants to
    AddressBookSystemTest increases cohesion within the class.
    
    This design has been in AB4 since its draft stage [1], and while no
    reason was given, it is likely that this implementation was adopted so
    as to allow other classes (such as SampleDataTest) to initialise
    TestApp with different saveFileLocations.
    
    Let's move SAVE_LOCATION_FOR_TESTING to AddressBookSystemTest.

    DeveloperGuide: update "Troubleshooting Testing" section
    
    Due to new privacy enhancements introduced in macOS Mojave, applications
    without `Accessibility` permission cannot simulate keyboard and mouse
    movements.
    
    This causes GUI tests that uses `CommandBoxHandle#run(...)` to execute
    commands to fail, as `CommandBoxHandle#run(...)` attempts to simulate
    pressing `Enter` key in the Command Box using `GuiRobot` (subclass of
    `org.testfx.api.FxRobot`).
    
    The `Enter` keypress event is then handled by
    `CommandBox#handleCommandEntered()`, which executes the command.
    
    However, because of insufficient privileges, `GuiRobot` may be unable to
    simulate the `Enter` keypress event in the Command Box, thus the handler
    method is not called. This results in the command in the Command Box to
    not get executed, which in turn causes the GUI tests to fail.
    
    To reduce confusion amongst developers using macOS Mojave, let's update
    the "Troubleshooting Testing" section to discuss this issue, and provide
    instructions on how to resolve it.

    StringUtilTest: Remove Hamcrest String matcher
    
    Currently, in StringUtilTest#getDetails_exceptionGiven, we use
    Hamcrest's string matching and assert libraries.
    This library was introduced in [1], however no justification was
    given on why we specifically used these Hamcrest libraries. In fact,
    this is the only instance in the entire project where we use this
    dependency.
    
    We are only using the assertThat and contains API of the Hamcrest
    library, whose corresponding functionality is already implemented in
    JUnit#assertTrue and Java String#contains. The only extra benefit that
    this Hamcrest library provides is in its more detailed error message
    when tests fail [2]. While convenient, this functionality is not
    absolutely critical. This is because developers can use the debugger
    to inspect the state of messages right before the error.
    
    There is more value in this case to standardise the usage of our
    assert statements. The Hamcrest library introduces a new API that
    developers of AB4 will have to learn. New developers might be confused
    why we use two different APIs to conduct tests. By standardising to
    use the JUnit assertTrue, we remove the need to learn multiple APIs,
    while achieving the same outcome.
    
    Hence, let's remove the Hamcrest libraries and replace them with their
    equivalent Java and JUnit APIs.

    ConfigTest contains an unused ExpectedException. It appears that the

    However, since its introduction, there have been no tests within

    StringUtilTest: rename isUnsignedPositiveInteger() to isNonZeroUnsignedInteger()
    
    Currently, StringUtilTest has a method named
    isUnsignedPositiveInteger. However, the method tested is actually
    named isNonZeroUnsignedInteger. This can cause confusion in the
    naming.
    
    It appears that, as early as #85 [1], the tested method was originally
    isUnsignedInteger(). However, the test method was named
    isUnsignedPositiveInteger() and was incorrect.
    Additionally, in #460 [2], the tested method was renamed to
    isNonZeroUnsignedInteger(), however the test was not renamed then.
    
    To maintain consistent naming convention, lets rename the test method
    to isNonZeroUnsignedInteger().

    a "wrapper" task is not required since Gradle will use the version
    specified in the `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file[3], which
    we already have.
    
    As we are planning to upgrade to Gradle 5.2.1, let's remove the wrapper
    task.

    diagrams: restore original LogicComponentSequenceDiagram.pptx
    
    The corresponding source pptx file for SDForDeletePerson.png is
    HighLevelSequenceDiagrams.pptx.
    
    However, when SDForDeletePerson.png was updated in 89ec0382 (Address
    book storage: migrate away from EventsCenter, 2018-12-09), the modified
    pptx file was written to LogicComponentSequenceDiagram.pptx instead of
    HighLevelSequenceDiagrams.pptx, overwriting
    LogicComponentSequenceDiagram.pptx's original content. This causes two
    problems:
    
     1. The contents of HighLevelSequenceDiagrams.pptx do not match
        SDForDeletePerson.png any more.
    
     2. As LogicComponentSequenceDiagram.pptx is the source pptx file for
        DeletePersonSdForLogic.png. This means that students who wish to
        modify DeletePersonSdForLogic.png do not have the source pptx
        any more.
    
    Fix these issues by first renaming LogicComponentSequenceDiagram.pptx to
    HighLevelSequenceDiagrams.pptx (fixing issue 1), and then restoring
    LogicComponentSequenceDiagram.pptx back to its original content[1]
    (fixing issue 2).

         2017-07-07), which is the last time

    PersonCard: display tags in sorted order
    
    The code in PersonCard for displaying Tags as Labels is as follows:
    
        person.getTags().forEach(tag -> tags.getChildren().add(new Label(tag.tagName)));
    
    However, `person.getTags()` is a Set (stored internally as a HashSet).
    Sets do not provide any ordering guarantees, which means that the order
    in which tags are displayed in the PersonCard is potentially
    non-deterministic. This means that two people having the same tags could
    potentially have their tags displayed in different orders, which could
    confuse and annoy users who expect AddressBook to behave in a
    predictable manner.
    
    Fix this by sorting the tags first before adding them as Labels, thus
    imposing an ordering on the tags. Lexicographical ordering based on the
    tag name is used since that's a commonly used ordering criterion.

    Move back to JDK 8
    
    We currently advertise that we support "JDK 9 and above". However,
    
      * JDK 9 and JDK 10 are no longer readily downloadable from Oracle's
        website as they have "reached end of support"[1][2],
    
      * JDK 10 on Windows will crash when running tests in headless mode due
        to a JavaFX bug[3],
    
      * JDK 11 and above can't be easily used with our project as JavaFX is
        not distributed with Oracle JDK 11 and above anymore[4].
    
    As these issues will likely not be resolved anytime soon, let's
    temporarily downgrade our project to JDK 8 for now, since it is stil
    available on Oracle's website, at least until the end of January.
    
    The commits which upgraded our project from JDK 8 to JDK 9+ are:
    
      * 889a1051 (build.gradle: upgrade to use Java 9, 2018-03-01)
    
      * 544d89bf (Warn developers against using JDK 10 on Windows,
        2018-06-30)
    
      * 5383298a (DeveloperGuide: update "Setting up" section, 2018-09-08),
        which is only applicable with JDK 9 and above since it deals with
        the Java module system.
    
    So let's revert them, with the following exceptions:
    
      * We keep the TestFX version at our current version (4.0.12-alpha),
        since it supports JDK 8.
    
      * We use openjfx-monocle version 8u76-b04 since that is the latest
        version of openjfx-monocle that supports JDK 8.
    
      * We do not revert the changes 889a1051 made to gradle.properties,
        since the changes were to remove flags that were already deprecated
        in JDK 8.
    
      * We keep the minimum Java version at `1.8.0_201` (the lowest version
        available on Oracle's JDK 8 download page[5]), since we have not
        tested the current code base with JDK 8 versions lower than that.
    
      * We make it clear in the User Guide / Developer Guide that we only
        support JDK 8 (not JDK 9, 10, 11 etc.)

    Address book storage: migrate away from EventsCenter
    
    When the model's address book is modified, ModelManager will post an
    AddressBookChangedEvent to EventsCenter. StorageManager will then
    respond by calling StorageManager#saveAddressBook(...) to save the
    address book.
    
    If an error occurs while saving the address book, StorageManager will
    post a DataSavingExceptionEvent to EventsCenter. UiManager will then
    respond by showing an alert dialog.
    
    As we are going to remove EventsCenter in the future, let's migrate
    these mechanisms away from EventsCenter.
    
    Let's teach LogicManager to listen for invalidation events from
    ModelManager's AddressBook. If an invalidation event occurs (which
    indicates that the AddressBook was likely modified), LogicManager will
    then call Storage#saveAddressBook(...) after command execution. If an
    error occurs, this will then be sent to the caller via exceptions. The
    end result is that the control flow is much clearer and explicit in the
    code.
    
    Note that the new implementation differs in the handling of address book
    storage errors: previously an error dialog would be shown. Now, the
    error would be reported by the ResultDisplay. This approach is chosen as
    its much simpler -- we can simply reuse the same battle-tested code
    paths for handling command errors. Furthermore, the overall goal is
    still achieved as the error is still reported to the user.
    
    The Developer Guide describes in detail how address book saving works
    under the section "Events-Driven nature of the design". As such, we'll
    need to update it. Since at this point most of the codebase is not using
    EventsCenter, let's rewrite the entire section into one that describes,
    in high-level detail, how architectural components interact with each
    other.

    StatusBarFooter: migrate away from EventsCenter
    
    StatusBarFooter has a "last updated" status which displays when the
    address book was last modified.
    
    This is implemented as follows: When ModelManager's address book is
    modified, it will post an AddressBookChangedEvent event to EventsCenter.
    StatusBarFooter will then respond to it by updating its "last updated"
    status to the current time.
    
    As we are going to remove EventsCenter in the future, let's migrate this
    mechanism away from EventsCenter.
    
    Rather than listening for AddressBookChangedEvents, lets teach
    StatusBarFooter to listen for invalidation events from the AddressBook
    directly.

    AddressBook: make Observable
    
    In the next few commits, we will be removing AddressBookChangedEvent in
    order to migrate the codebase away from EventsCenter.
    
    However, to do so, the codebase needs another way to monitor AddressBook
    for changes.
    
    They could do so by listening for changes to AddressBook's person list
    (which is an ObservableList). This might work since any changes to an
    AddressBook is done to its person list. However, its not a future-proof
    solution as we may add more fields to AddressBook in the future, which
    would need to be observed as well.
    
    As such, let's implement a more comprehensive solution by making
    AddressBook implement the Observable interface, so that our codebase can
    monitor AddressBook for changes by attaching invalidation listeners to
    it. Whenever a mutating method of AddressBook is called, the attached
    invalidation listeners will be called. This design can be consistently
    used no matter how many pieces of data AddressBook stores.
    
    The javafx.beans.Observable interface was chosen to allow this
    implementation to interoperate easily with JavaFX's API.

    BrowserPanel/PersonListPanel: migrate away from EventsCenter
    
    The selection of a person in the filtered person list is communicated to
    PersonListPanel and BrowserPanel via events through EventsCenter:
    
      * SelectCommand will first post a JumpToListRequestEvent to
        EventsCenter. PersonListPanel will then respond by scrolling to that
        person in the list and selecting it.
    
      * When the PersonListPanel's selection changes (via the above
        mechanism or when the user selects a new person via the list panel),
        PersonListPanel will post a PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent to
        EventsCenter. BrowserPanel will then respond by navigating to the
        person's respective URL.
    
    As we are going to remove EventsCenter in the future, let's migrate
    these mechanisms away from EventsCenter:
    
      * We first explicitly model the currently selected person in Model.
        SelectCommand would thus "select" a person by calling
        Model#setSelectedPerson(Person).
    
      * Next, we teach PersonListPanel and BrowserPanel to listen for
        changes to the selected person by observing
        Model#selectedPersonProperty().
    
      * Finally, we teach PersonListPanel to call
        Model#setSelectedPerson(Person) if the user changes the selected
        person via the UI.
    
    This approach is chosen over alternatives (such as re-implementing the
    original event-based approach directly using callbacks) as it provides
    the following additional advantages:
    
      * Since, by our definition, the selected person must _always_ be a
        valid person in the filtered person list, it naturally implements a
        user request[1] to clear the browser panel when the address book is
        cleared.
    
      * It provides a single source of truth for the currently selected
        person, and thus opening up the possibility of us implementing
        commands in the future that operate on the currently selected
        person, rather than requring users to provide an index each time.

    ExitCommand: use CommandResult to signal MainWindow to exit
    
    To make the application exit, ExitCommand will post a
    ExitAppRequestEvent to EventsCenter. MainWindow will then respond by
    hiding itself (and its HelpWindow if open). Since JavaFX will exit when
    all windows are closed, this will cause the application to exit.
    
    As we are going to remove EventsCenter in the future, let's migrate this
    mechanism away from EventsCenter.
    
    Let's add an `exit` flag to CommandResult, and teach ExitCommand to use
    this flag to signal to MainWindow to exit. Teach MainWindow to respond
    to this flag by hiding itself (and its HelpWindow if open).

    HelpCommand: use CommandResult to signal MainWindow to show help
    
    To show the help window, HelpCommand will post a ShowHelpRequestEvent to
    EventsCenter. MainWindow will then respond to it by showing the
    HelpWindow.
    
    As we are going to remove EventsCenter in the future, let's migrate this
    mechanism away from EventsCenter.
    
    Let's add a `showHelp` flag to CommandResult, and teach HelpCommand to
    use this flag to signal to MainWindow to show the HelpWindow. Teach
    MainWindow to respond to this flag by showing the HelpWindow.
    
    Since most commands would _not_ be setting the `showHelp` flag, let's
    also add a CommandResult(String) convenience constructor, that just sets
    the `feedbackToUser`.
    
    As CommandResult now contains more than one field, rather than just
    verifying `feedbackToUser`, our tests would need to verify the entire
    state of the CommandResult object to be thorough. As such, let's teach
    CommandTestUtil#assertCommandSuccess(...) to verify the entire
    CommandResult object. At the same time, as mentioned above, most
    commands would not be setting any of the flags in CommandResult. As
    such, let's add a convenience wrapper that accepts a string
    `feedbackToUser`.
    
    Update the Developer Guide to show that CommandResult can now instruct
    the Ui to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

    ResultDisplay: migrate away from EventsCenter
    
    When MainWindow gets a CommandResult or exception from calling
    Logic#execute(String), it would notify ResultDisplay of the result by
    posting a NewResultAvailableEvent to EventsCenter.
    
    As we are going to remove EventsCenter in the future, let's migrate
    ResultDisplay away from EventCenter.
    
    Rather than having this event-posting-and-receiving arrangement, let's
    add a ResultDisplay#setFeedbackToUser() method to ResultDisplay, and
    teach MainWindow to call this method when it receives a CommandResult
    from Logic#execute(String).

    ui: move command execution responsibility from CommandBox to MainWindow
    
    CommandBox is the UiPart responsible for command execution (i.e calling
    Logic#execute(String) and processing its return value).
    
    In the next few commits, we want the methods of other UiParts to be
    called when command execution occurs.
    
    However, CommandBox does not have access to the other UiParts in the
    main window. (And it should not, to be consistent with our architecture
    design).
    
    On the other hand, MainWindow _does_ have access to the other UiParts in
    the MainWindow.
    
    As such, let's make MainWindow responsible for command execution.
    CommandBox will use callbacks to notify MainWindow that it should
    execute a command.
    
    Since now MainWindow, instead of CommandBox, is the class that directly
    calls Logic#execute(String), update the Ui class diagram to reflect this
    updated relationship.

    Keep a strong reference to created unmodifiableObservableLists
    
    The observable list created with
    FXCollections.unmodifiableObservableList(...) installs a "weak listener"
    -- that is, the backing list only keeps a weak reference to the
    unmodifiable list. This means that if there is no other strong reference
    pointing to the created unmodifiable observable list, it would be
    garbage collected.
    
    This becomes a problem when other code attaches event listeners to the
    unmodifiable list, with the expectation that it would be called whenever
    the backing list changes. When the unmodifiable list is garbage
    collected, the event listeners will not be called any more, which could
    cause incorrect application behavior.
    
    Fix this by making the code base keep a strong reference to each
    unmodifiable observable list, and return the same unmodifiable
    observable list whenever its getter is called.

    BrowserPanel#DEFAULT_PAGE: provide full URL
    
    BrowserPanel#DEFAULT_PAGE has the value of "default.html". However, the
    value itself doesn't give us the full picture since it does not tell us
    _where_ exactly "default.html" is located.
    
    As such, our test code has to duplicate this information in various
    places:
    
        MainApp.class.getResource(FXML_FILE_FOLDER + DEFAULT_PAGE)
    
    (namely, that "default.html" is inside the FXML_FILE_FOLDER, and
    FXML_FILE_FOLDER is relative to MainApp's package)
    
    Remove this duplication of information by making DEFAULT_PAGE provide
    the _full_ URL, so that we can DRY up the test code.
    
    At the same time, wrap the initialization of DEFAULT_PAGE with a
    requireNonNull(...), so that we can detect as early as possible whether
    the "default.html" page is missing, which should help in debugging.

    MainApp: don't forcefully terminate the application on exit
    
    When MainApp receives an ExitAppRequestEvent, it forcefully terminates
    the application with:
    
        Platform.exit();
        System.exit(0);
    
    However, this makes testing the `exit` command extremely hard. This is
    because in the JUnit environment, calling System.exit(...) will cause
    the test runner to terminate as well, causing tests to not properly be
    run. Likewise, TestFX expects the JavaFX event loop to be running for
    the entire duration of all tests, and thus calling Platform.exit() will
    cause TestFX to become stuck [1]. As such, tests such as
    MainWindowCloseTest work around this by checking to see if the
    ExitAppRequestEvent is raised instead.
    
    But really, we don't need to call Platform.exit() or System.exit().
    This is because by default, once all windows are closed, JavaFX will
    automatically begin the shutdown process and call Application#stop().
    
    As such, let's tweak our implementation so that we trigger JavaFX
    shutdown by closing all windows -- namely, closing all MainWindows and
    HelpWindows.
    
    This is accomplished by shifting the handling of ExitAppRequestEvent to
    MainWindow. MainWindow will handle it by hiding itself and its
    HelpWindow. Since there can only be one HelpWindow to each MainWindow,
    and all MainWindows will respond to the ExitAppRequestEvent, this would
    essentially cause all open windows to be hidden.
    
    Likewise, MainWindowCloseTest does not need to check for
    ExitAppRequestEvent any more -- it can simply check if all windows are
    closed (and the JavaFX framework shutdown is thus implied). This would
    make it more like a black box test and thus more resilient to changes in
    internal implementation details in the future.
    
    [1] See 088db25e (MainWindow.fxml: update onCloseRequest event to call
        handleExit(), 2018-02-16) for a discussion of these issues.

    Logic: expose command history as an ObservableList
    
    The command history is exposed to the UI via Logic#getHistorySnapshot(),
    which returns a ListElementPointer.
    
    However, this API interface is unnecessarily limiting by assuming that
    clients would only want to look at the history by iterating through its
    contents one-by-one. It makes it difficult for the UI to expose the
    command history to the user via other means, such as showing the full
    history in a ListBox.
    
    Fix this by exposing the command history as an ObservableList, which
    supports a much wider range of operations. Making it observable would
    also make it more consistent with the observable design of our
    Model/Logic APIs to make it easy for UI elements to respond to changes
    in model data.
    
    Since ListElementPointer is not used by the logic layer anymore, move it
    to the seedu.address.ui package. This is likely a much more suitable
    package for it, as its design is pretty specialized to how CommandBox
    operates and thus it likely can't find much use elsewhere.

    docs: remove DummySearchPage
    
    The DummySearchPage was introduced in 29b02b49 (docs: add
    DummySearchPage.html, 2018-02-02). With it, additional build steps were
    added to the build.gradle, .travis.yml files so that the DummySearchPage
    would be copied into the build/docs/html5 directory, and would be
    deployed with the rest of the documentation to
    https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4/DummySearchPage.html.
    
    However, this also meant that downstream forks would also receive these
    additional build steps, even though they do not need them. We only need
    one single DummySearchPage to be published at one single public URL, and
    thus these build steps are unnecessary for downstream forks.
    
    We have already copied the DummySearchPage and published it at
    https://se-edu.github.io/dummy-search-page/. As such, let's remove the
    DummySearchPage and build steps from this codebase, so that we can
    simplify our build and CI configuration.

    ci: do not retry on test failures
    
    Whenever test failures occur, our Travis and Appveyor configurations
    will re-run the entire test script, up to 3 times.
    
    Re-running tests is usually used as a workaround when certain tests are
    flaky. However, in this case, it does more harm than good:
    
      * If the tests are indeed failing due to a problem with the code, the
        build time would still be extremely long due to the unnecessary
        test-retrying. This could cause unnecessary jams in our build
        queues.
    
      * If we accidentally introduce a flaky test, developers who only test
        via the CI, and do not view the logs of CI jobs that pass, will
        likely not find out since the tests are re-run until they pass
        (unless they happen to fail all 3 times).  For development purposes,
        it is more beneficial if we are alerted to flaky tests as soon as
        possible, preferably before the code is even merged.
    
      * If we _do_ have flaky tests, the tests should be individually marked
        "to be retried" using JUnit's mechanisms, rather than leaving it to
        the CI configuration. This would both help save build time (since
        only the flaky test would be re-run) and would be more explicit
        (since the flaky test is clearly marked out in code).
    
    As such, let's change our CI configuration to not retry on test
    failures.

    It claims to "free resources allocated to the browser" by doing:

    Also of note is that the HelpWindow, which also uses a browser, does not

    UserPrefs is mutable. However, there are some places in the codebase
    (e.g. Storage#saveUserPrefs(...)) where this mutability is not required.
    In fact, it would be beneficial to ensure that these places do _not_

    introduce a ReadOnlyUserPrefs counterpart to UserPrefs, which only
    provides access to the getters of the UserPrefs object.

    Model#resetData(ReadOnlyAddressBook) takes a ReadOnlyAddressBook, and
    replaces the address book data in the model with the data in that
    ReadOnlyAddressBook. As such, a name which more aptly describes what the
    method does would be `setAddressBook`.
    
    Additionally, in the future we will be adding another component
    (`UserPrefs`) into the model. Users may want to only wish to replace the
    data in the model's address book without touching the other data in the
    model, and so having a separate `setAddressBook` method would be useful.

    UserPrefs: make guiSettings non-nullable
    
    UserPrefs#guiSettings can be internally `null`. If that is so,
    UserPrefs#getGuiSettings() will return a `new GuiSettings()`.
    
    Generally, for the AB-4 codebase, we try not to make fields nullable
    unless absolutely necessary -- this is because more code will need to be
    written to handle the case when a field is null, and more code = more
    bugs.
    
    In this case, it is not necessary for guiSettings to be nullable.
    In fact, in normal operation of AB-4, guiSettings will *never* be null:
    
      * When deserializing a JSON file which does not have guiSettings
        specified, the default value of guiSettings will be used, which is
        not null. (This is because deserialization will call the no-arg
        constructor of UserPrefs, which will initialize guiSettings to a
        non-null value)
    
      * For all usages of UserPrefs#setGuiSettings(...), the provided
        GuiSettings is not null.
    
    So, let's make this field non-nullable.
    
    (In fact, if guiSettings is null, UserPrefs#toString() will throw an NPE
    :-P)

        then need to have x * z setters in total. Much better to keep things

    UserPrefs: use default GuiSettings values
    
    UserPrefs overrides the default width, height and coordinates of
    GuiSettings. This makes the default width/height/coordinates defined in
    GuiSettings redundant.
    
    Furthermore, UserPrefs has no reason to override GuiSettings' defaults.
    
    Let's make UserPrefs use GuiSettings' defaults instead, rather than
    using its own.

    GuiSettings#equals(...): fix NPE when windowCoordinates is null
    
    If `this.windowCoordinates` or `o.windowCoordinates` is null,
    GuiSettings#equals(...) will throw an NPE, since it assumes that they
    are both non-null. However, the API contract is such that
    windowCoordinates is nullable.
    
    Fix this by calling `Objects.equals(windowCoordinates,
    o.windowCoordinates)` directly. Since `Point#equals(...)` will compare
    the x and y values of the Points in question, the behavior would be the
    same as the original code.

    GuiSettings: make deeply immutable
    
    GuiSettings' users (most prominently, UserPrefs), assumes that
    GuiSettings is deeply immutable. However, GuiSettings isn't actually
    deeply immutable yet.
    
    Let's make GuiSettings deeply immutable by:
    
      * Making GuiSettings#getWindowCoordinates() return a copy of the
        java.awt.Point rather than directly, as Points are mutable.
    
      * Marking GuiSettings' fields as final.
    
      * Stating this guarantee in the javadoc so that clients can rely on
        it.

    ModelClassBetterOopDiagram: simplify to its bare essentials
    
    ModelClassBetterOopDiagram is used in the Developer Guide to show how
    the storage of tags in the model can be tweaked to be made "more OOP".
    
    As such, ModelClassBetterOopDiagram is mostly similar to
    ModelClassDiagram with relatively few differences. This means that
    whenever ModelClassDiagram changes, the changes must be replicated in
    ModelClassBetterOopDiagram as well. This unnecessarily increases the
    maintenance effort.
    
    Fix this by stripping down ModelClassBetterOopDiagram to its bare
    essentials -- the places where it differs from ModelClassDiagram. This
    way, ModelClassBetterOopDiagram won't need to be updated as often.

    JSON storage adapters: make package-private
    
    The JSON storage adapters' (JsonSerializableAddressBook,
    JsonAdaptedPerson, JsonAdaptedTag) sole purpose is to adapt their
    respective model classes into a form that is serializable/deserializable
    by Jackson.
    
    As such, they are an internal implementation detail of the storage
    layer, and should not be used directly by classes in other architecture
    components.
    
    To enforce this constraint, make them package-private.

    Remove all JAXB/XML-related code from the codebase
    
    JAXB has been deprecated and has already been removed in JDK 11[1].
    
    Our codebase also does not require JAXB or XML support any more -- we
    have already migrated our codebase to use Jackson (JSON) fully for the
    storage layer.
    
    So, let's fully remove all JAXB/XML-related code from the codebase, so
    we can remove JAXB as a dependency from our build.gradle file.
    
    Once that is done, we won't have the "IntelliJ reports code errors for
    JAXB imports" problem as described in 5383298a (DeveloperGuide: update
    "Setting up" section, 2018-09-08). The problem still remains for JavaFX,
    however. Tweak the DeveloperGuide to reflect this.

    Use JSON as the address book serialization format
    
    JAXB has been deprecated and has already been removed in JDK11[1].
    
    In response to this, we have been moving towards removing any use of
    JAXB on our codebase. In previous commits, we have implemented a
    fully-functioning JsonAddressBookStorage, using Jackson, for
    serializing/deserializing AddressBooks in JSON format.
    
    Now, let's flip the switch and make JsonAddressBookStorage _the_
    AddressBookStorage that MainApp uses. This means that JSON is now our
    official address book serialization format.
    
    A variety of small tweaks need to be made in the same commit to avoid
    breakage:
    
      * Since the application stores the address book in JSON format, it
        would be more suitable for all address book-related files to have a
        `.json` extension instead of an `.xml` extension.
    
      * Changing the storage implementation now requires editing
        JsonAddressBookStorage, JsonAdaptedPerson etc. instead of the XML
        counterparts. Update the DeveloperGuide to reflect this.
    
      * StorageManagerTest contains some integration tests to ensure that
        StorageManager is properly wired to XmlAddressBookStorage. Since
        StorageManager now uses JsonAddressBookStorage, modify
        StorageManagerTest to reflect that.
    
      * Since JsonAddressBookStorage, JsonAdaptedPerson etc. are now the
        storage classes that are actually used, update the storage component
        class diagram in the DeveloperGuide to reflect this.

    storage: implement JsonAddressBookStorage and related classes
    
    We are going to be migrating our storage layer from JAXB (XML) to
    Jackson (JSON).
    
    As a first step, introduce JsonAddressBookStorage and its related
    classes. These classes implement serializing and deserializing
    AddressBooks into JSON format, using Jackson.
    
    JsonAdaptedPerson, JsonAdaptedTag and JsonSerializableAddressBook share
    most of the same code and design as their JAXB-based counterparts
    (XmlAdaptedPerson, XmlAdaptedTag and XmlSerializableAddressBook).
    
    Likewise, copy over the tests from XmlAdaptedPerson, XmlAdaptedTag,
    XmlSerializableAddressBook etc. However, unlike XML files, JSON files do
    not support comments, and so we'll need to be a bit creative with the
    test JSON files.

    PersonListPanelTest: remove `manyPersons.xml` file creation
    
    The only user of createXmlFileWithPersons(int) is
    createBackingList(int). As mentioned in its javadoc, the _only_ thing
    that createBackingList(int) needs to do is to return a list of
    `personCount` persons.
    
    As such, we don't need to go though the trouble of _actually_ creating
    an XML file of `personCount` persons, and then loading it.
    
    So, let's just generate the list of persons directly in memory.
    
    Note that this won't break the intent of
    PersonListPanelTest#performanceTest(), which is the only user of
    createBackingList(int). This is because the test doesn't aim to test the
    performance of address book file deserialization at all.

    Model: rename updatePerson(...) to setPerson(...)
    
    The method name `updatePerson` is a holdover from the time when Person
    was mutable, and this method worked by directly modifying the target
    person.
    
    However, in a5cb7900 (UniquePersonList: Simplify logic of
    updatePerson(...), 2017-08-05), the behavior was changed such that the
    target person was not directly modified, but rather _replaced_ with a
    new Person with the modified details.
    
    Following that, in b2eeb18b (Person: Make immutable, 2017-12-20), Person
    was made immutable.
    
    So, now it doesn't make sense to say that we "update" the target person.
    
    As such, let's rename updatePerson(...) to setPerson(...), which is a
    better description of what the method does. This also makes the naming
    consistent with AddressBook#setPerson(...) and
    UniquePersonList#setPerson(...), which all do the same thing.

    PersonListPanelTest#createXmlFileWithPersons(): Fix incorrect path
    
    createXmlFileWithPersons() saves the location of the temporarily
    generated .xml file to:
    
        src/test/data/sandboxmanyPersons.xml
    
    instead of:
    
        src/test/data/sandbox/manyPersons.xml
    
    It is likely that the original author of the test intended the saving
    location to be the latter, given that it has always resolved to the
    latter until we revamped the path handling logic in AddressBook to use
    java.nio.file.Path API, which introduced this discrepancy (commit
    9eac635d9da1a71c81587ba66cab1911977a863b).
    
    Saving the temporary .xml file to the 'sandbox' folder is also ideal as
    the folder is git-ignored, so even if JVM crashes and does not clean
    up the temporary file, students would not accidentally commit this
    potentially _enormous_ .xml file into the repository.
    
    Let's fix the incorrect path.

    HelpWindowTest: fix bogus "focus on another stage" code
    
    When run in head-full mode, HelpWindowTest fails with the following
    exception:
    
        seedu.address.ui.HelpWindowTest > focus_helpWindowNotFocused_focused FAILED
            java.lang.AssertionError at HelpWindowTest.java:64
    
    The line in question is from the following:
    
        assertFalse(helpWindow.getRoot().isFocused());
    
    which comes right after:
    
        // Focus on another stage to remove focus from the helpWindow
        FxToolkit.setupStage(Stage::requestFocus);
    
    However, despite what the comment claims, the call to
    FxToolkit.setupStage(...) does not "focus on another stage". This is
    because the Stage registered with TestFX is the HelpWindow stage itself.
    In other words, we are just requesting the HelpWindow to focus itself,
    which is the complete opposite of "removing focus from the helpWindow".
    
    This "focus on another stage" code was written in 1c6071fa
    (HelpWindowTest: fix failing test in non-headless mode, 2018-04-16). At
    that point in time, the stage registered with TestFX _was_ "another
    stage"[1] and so the code was correct. However, in a42ededd (Fix
    stalling HelpWindowTest, 2018-06-26) this was changed such that the
    stage registered with TestFX is the HelpWindow stage itself. Yet, the
    code was not modified to properly operate in the new world order[2].
    
    Fix this piece of code by creating a temporary stage to focus on, so
    that the goal of "removing focus from the helpWindow" is properly
    achieved.
    
    [1]: Somewhat-ish. The full story can be found in a42ededd (Fix stalling
         HelpWindowTest, 2018-06-26).

    ModelManager: remove synchronization from methods
    
    Synchronized methods are only useful when multiple threads could access
    the same object at the same time[1].
    
    However, when our application is run, only the JavaFX application thread
    should have access to the model. When running GUI tests, the main thread
    (running the tests) and the JavaFX application thread will both have
    access to the model, but the synchronization implemented internally in
    TestFX should ensure that only one thread accesses the model at any
    given time.
    
    As such, the model does not require synchronization. If any of the above
    conditions do not hold, it is a bug and should be fixed directly, not
    papered over by adding locks. Depending on the JVM's implementation
    details and whether is having a good or bad day, such careless use of
    synchronization could lead to a performance penalty[2].
    
    So, let's remove the synchronization from ModelManager's methods, and
    remove the synchronization requirement from its javadoc.
    
    [1]: But even then, they're not a silver bullet.

    XmlAdaptedPerson#toModelType(): remove shadowing of fields
    
    The method body references the fields of XmlAdaptedPerson (`name`,
    `phone`, etc.), but also shadows them later on by declaring local
    variables with the same name.
    
    Such mixing of instance fields and local variables within the same
    method is out of the ordinary in the code base, and can be accidentally
    mis-read if the reader is not paying attention.

    Remove unnecessary uses of `this`
    
    According to our Java coding standard[1], we should only use the `this`
    keyword when the field is shadowed by a method or constructor parameter.
    
    So, let's remove all unnecessary uses of `this` from our code base.

    [#829] Update TestUtil to use filteredList (#900)
    
    Methods in TestUtil such as getMidIndex(Model), getLastIndex(Model)
    and getPerson(Model, Index) return the index and person based on the
    entire address book instead of the model's filtered list.
    
    When tests require a filtered list, we will get the incorrect person
    or index upon calling these methods in TestUtil.
    
    Let's update these methods in TestUtil to return values from the
    model's filtered list.

    XmlSerializableAddressBook: check for duplicate person(s)
    
    When the address book XML file happens to contain duplicate person(s),
    XmlSerializableAddressBook#toModelType() will throw an unchecked
    DuplicatePersonException instead of the checked IllegalValueException
    which it promises to throw.
    
    This is because XmlSerializableAddressBook#toModelType() relied on
    AddressBook#addPerson(Person) throwing DuplicatePersonException when a
    duplicate person is encountered. Since DuplicatePersonException
    inherited from DuplicateDataException, which in turn inherited from
    IllegalValueException, this gave rise to the expected behavior.
    
    However, 6817bd35 (model: make DuplicatePersonException a
    RuntimeException, 2018-08-07) made DuplicatePersonException inherit from
    RuntimeException. Since this commit, all callers of
    AddressBook#addPerson(Person) are expected to perform the duplicate
    person check using AddressBook#hasPerson(Person). Yet,
    XmlSerializableAddressBook#toModelType() was not updated.
    
    Fix this by teaching XmlSerializableAddressBook#toModelType() to
    explicitly check for duplicate persons using
    AddressBook#hasPerson(Person). Add a test to prevent future regressions.

    Combine Command#setData(...) and Command#execute() together (#898)
    
    Ensure that all command tests verify their model state and command

    Our commands forgot that their bound model and commandHistory are part

    Command: combine setData(...) and execute() together
    
    To execute a command, (e.g. AddCommand), we need to
    
      1. Construct it:
    
             AddCommand addCommand = new AddCommand(person);
    
      2. Bind the model and command history to it:
    
             addCommand.setData(model, commandHistory);
    
      3. And then execute it:
    
             addCommand.execute();
    
    However, there is no reason why step (2) and step (3) must be separate,
    when it could just be:
    
        addCommand.execute(model, commandHistory);
    
    In fact, it causes more trouble:
    
      * Since the model and commandHistory are stored as protected fields in
        the Command base class, many commands forget to handle them
        appropriately. For example, all commands don't consider the model
        and commandHistory in their `#equals(...)` methods, even though
        these fields are part of their state.
    
      * Many command tests need to introduce a helper `prepareCommand(...)`
        method to streamline the command "setData and execute" process.
    
    So, let's fix this by combining Command#setData(...) and
    Command#execute() together. We can then simplify all the command tests
    by removing their `prepareCommand(...)` helper methods.

    Command tests: verify CommandHistory as well
    
    When executing a command, LogicManager will pass its CommandHistory to
    the command being executed.
    
    While commands can examine the CommandHistory, they should not modify
    it. However, our command tests (in `seedu.address.logic.commands`) do
    not verify the CommandHistory at all.
    
    Let's teach them to verify the CommandHistory. This is done by teaching
    CommandTestUtil.assertCommandSuccess(...) and
    CommandTestUtil.assertCommandFailure(...) to verify that the
    CommandHistory is not modified.

    model: convert checked exceptions to runtime exceptions (#896)
    
    DuplicatePersonException and PersonNotFoundException are checked
    exceptions. They are thrown by methods to signify that their relevant
    preconditions were violated.
    
    Using checked exceptions for such a purpose is slightly useful in that
    it will force callers to handle the case where the above preconditions
    are not met, such as when the methods are called with invalid user
    input.
    
    However, it imposes a HUGE cost on callers where the preconditions are
    already known to be met (e.g. in test code, or when the user input has
    already been validated before hand). In such a case, callers are forced
    to add try-catch blocks around the method call even if they know that
    the exception will never be thrown, bloating up the code. It is also
    impossible to test the catch blocks as well since correct code will
    ensure that the precondition holds and thus the exception will never be
    thrown, leading to reduced code coverage.
    
    Checked exceptions also don't work very well with the Java Streams API,
    since the API doesn't accept lambdas which could throw checked
    exceptions.
    
    In AB-4, the amount of code which benefits from DuplicatePersonException
    and PersonNotFoundException being checked exceptions is much smaller
    than the amount of code which is negatively impacted.
    
    As such, let's make the tradeoff in the other direction, by making
    DuplicatePersonException and PersonNotFoundException runtime exceptions.
    New callers _could_ forget to check that the preconditions hold before
    calling the methods in question (although test cases should catch that),
    but this is balanced out by the huge benefit of having more concise and
    testable code.

    ParserUtil: remove `Optional` variants of parse methods
    
    As the comment[1] at the top of ParserUtil says, methods that take
    `Optional` as a parameter are bad.
    
    So, let's remove them.
    
    (It could be argued that leaving these methods in the code base could
    serve as an example for students of what not to do, but really, (1) the
    number of things that are forbidden under "best practice" is quite
    numerous, and trying to add an example of every single one of them in
    our code base would just lead to an annoyingly smelly code base, and (2)
    students will need to spend time cleaning up all of these negative
    examples, which is an unnecessary burden. These things would be better
    documented in style guides.)

        public static void fail(String message) {
            if (message == null) {
                throw new AssertionError();
            }
            throw new AssertionError(message);
        }
    
    where `AssertionError` is our favorite `java.lang.AssertionError`.
    
    In other words, calling `fail(String)` is no different from writing
    `throw new AssertionError(...)`.
    
    The latter has a further benefit, though -- it informs the Java compiler
    that the code path terminates at that point. This is useful when we are
    inside a function that has a non-void return type -- if we used
    `fail(String)`, we will still need to `return` a dummy value at the end
    to satisfy the compiler, whereas if we used
    `throw new AssertionError(...)` we do not need to do that.
    
    So, let's use `throw new AssertionError(...)` consistently throughout
    the code base.

    Use chained exceptions consistently throughout the code base
    
    In some places of our code, we respond to an exception by throwing
    another exception.
    
    In such a situation, it is good practice to _chain_ the exceptions by
    passing the initial exception as a `cause` to the next exception. This
    is because it provides more information to higher-level exception
    handlers, allowing them to e.g. provide more meaningful stack traces
    that show how the exception is handled and transformed as it is
    propagated through the call stack.
    
    However, certain places in our code base do not use exception chaining
    when they could. These were discovered by grepping the code base for
    `\bthrow\b` and seeing if any of the thrown exceptions fit the criteria
    described above.
    
    Let's fix them to use chained exceptions.
    
    See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/chained.html
    for more information on chained exceptions.

    Remove use of `junit.framework` package
    
    There are certain places in our code base where we use classes from the
    `junit.framework` package.
    
    The `junit.framework` package exists for backwards-compatibility with
    JUnit 3[1]. We are not a legacy code base stuck on JUnit 3, thus we
    should use the JUnit 4 API.
    
    Replace uses of the `junit.framework` package with the JUnit 4 API
    equivalents, namely:
    
     * Rather than using `junit.framework.TestCase.assertNotNull`, use the
       JUnit 4 API's `org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull`[2].
    
     * Rather than using `junit.framework.AssertionFailedError`, use
       `java.lang.AssertionError` instead, since that is what is thrown by
       the JUnit 4 API on assertion failures.
    
    [1] From the package-info.java of `junit.framework` at

    parsers: remove unnecessary catch-throws of ParseExceptions
    
    These try-catch blocks simply catch the ParseException, and then throw a
    new ParseException with the exact same message and the caught
    ParseException as its cause.
    
    This catch-throwing of ParseExceptions does not add any value, so let's
    remove them. This has the side benefit of removing one level of

    .gitattributes: treat all *.pdf files as binary
    
    Some students may wish to commit PDF files into their downstream repos.
    
    The PDF file format[1] is _mostly_ text-like. As such, it is likely that
    the first 8000 bytes of any PDF file will _not_ contain a NUL byte,
    leading Git to treat the PDF file as a text file[2].
    
    In AddressBook-Level4, our Travis `run-checks` scripts requires all text
    files, as determined by Git, to fulfill certain requirements such as
    only having LF line endings and not having any trailing whitespace.
    
    However, PDF files, although usually determined by Git to be text files,
    may not actually be _fully_ text. Particularly, PDF files may contain
    embedded binary streams which contain arbitrary binary data.
    
    This arbitrary binary data can cause PDF files to fail our Travis
    `run-checks` scripts.
    
    Given that PDFs _can_ contain binary data, it would thus make more sense
    to treat the entire file as binary. This both allows them to pass our
    `run-checks` scripts, as well as to prevent Git from giving
    not-very-useful text diffs when the PDF files are modified.
    
    As such, let's tell Git to treat all *.pdf files as binary.

    [#855] Refactor PersonBuilder constructor to use TypicalPersons as argument (#889)
    
    When creating a Person for testing, some tests specify almost all of
    the fields of an existing TypicalPerson, with only a slight variation
    in one or two fields. For example, the code below builds on top of
    TypicalPerson#AMY with only changes to address and tags:
    
        toAdd = new PersonBuilder().withName(VALID_NAME_AMY).withPhone(VALID_PHONE_AMY)
                .withEmail(VALID_EMAIL_AMY).withAddress(VALID_ADDRESS_BOB)
                .withTags(VALID_TAG_FRIEND).build();
    
    This is long-winded and unnecessary, as PersonBuilder allows us to start
    from a ready-made Person, and modify as necessary. For example, the code
    above can be refactored to:
    
        toAdd = new PersonBuilder(AMY).withAddress(VALID_ADDRESS_BOB).build();
    
    Let's refactor the calls to PersonBuilder to make them more concise.

    Decouple UndoableCommand from ReadOnlyAddressBook (#861)
    
    The undo/redo mechanism uses an UndoRedoStack stored in the
    LogicManager, which uses 2 stacks to store executed and undone
    UndoableCommands. The UndoableCommands stores the previousAddressBook
    state before execution, which is used to restore the AddressBook state
    during an undo command.
    
    This results in unnecessary coupling between the UndoableCommand (within
    the Logic Layer) and AddressBook (within the Model Layer).
    
    Let's add a new class, VersionedAddressBook which extends AddressBook
    and shift the undo redo machanism from UndoRedoStack in LogicManager to
    VersionedAddressBook in ModelManager. This VersionedAddressBook class
    will use a list to keep track of the different versions of AddressBook
    by maintaining a list of AddressBook States.
    
    Since VersionedAddressBook will store all the AddressBook states,
    UndoableCommand will no longer need to store the
    previousAddressBookState in itself.

    DeveloperGuide: update section on UndoRedoStack to VersionedAddressBook
    
    The app previously uses UndoRedoStack which stores the UndoableCommands
    in LogicManager for the undo/redo mechanism.
    
    Since the undo/redo machanism has been shifted to VersionedAddressBook
    which stores ReadOnlyAddressBook in a List, and has been moved to Model
    layer instead, the sections on undo/redo feature, Logic and Model
    component in DeveloperGuide is out of date.
    
    Also, commands that do not mutate the address book, such as
    FindCommand and ListCommand, will no longer clear the redoable
    address book states. This allows for redo commands to pass when we
    undo commands and execute a non-mutating command afterwards.
    
    UndoableCommand has also been removed from the codebase as well.
    
    Let's update the out of date sections in the DeveloperGuide, such
    as switching from UndoRedoStack to the updated VersionedAddressBook,
    how the undo/redo mechanism works, and remove any reference
    to UndoableCommand in DeveloperGuide.

    Remove UndoableCommand class
    
    UndoableCommand was previously used to undo and redo commands through
    its UndoableCommand#undo() and UndoableCommand#redo() method
    respectively.
    
    The undo/redo mechanism now uses an VersionedAddressBook which uses a
    list to keep track of the AddressBook's history. As such there is no
    longer a need for UndoableCommand class, and it should be removed for
    code quality purposes.
    
    Let's remove UndoableCommand class and its corresponding tests, as
    well as making all commands extend from Command class instead.
    
    Following this change, UndoableCommand#preprocessUndoableCommand() is
    no longer called when it is required for commands such as DeleteCommand
    and EditCommand. The intention of having
    UndoableCommand#preprocessUndoableCommand() was to resolve an issue[1]
    in our app.
    
    Since this issue is also resolved here by moving the undo/redo
    mechanism from UndoRedoStack to VersionedAddressBook which tracks
    AddressBook states instead of UndoableCommands, there is no longer a
    need for a separate method to preprocess the commands.
    
    Let's inline DeleteCommand#preprocessUndoableCommand() into
    DeleteCommand#execute() and EditCommand#preprocessUndoableCommand()
    into EditCommand#execute().

    HelpWindow: don't show site navigation bar
    
    The help window launched by the `help` command displays the rendered
    User Guide (UserGuide.html). However, it contains a navigation bar.
    
    This navigation bar is non-functional -- clicking on the links will not
    do anything because the files that they link to are not found. This
    is because we only copy in `UserGuide.html` to the resources directory,
    and not the rest of the documentation.
    
    As such, let's hide the navigation bar when the User Guide is displayed
    in the Help Window.
    
    To do this, introduce a separate document, HelpWindow.adoc, that is only
    meant to be displayed inside the help window. This document just
    includes the contents of UserGuide.adoc verbatim, with one exception: it
    sets the `no-site-header` attribute, thus disabling the rendering of the
    navigation bar.

    browsing (AddressBook-Level4), and will provide convenient links to
    frequently-used documents, such as the User Guide and Developer Guide.
    
    Implement this navigation bar using the templating mechanism that we
    have set up over the past few commits, and document it in the Developer
    Guide.
    
    Some important concerns that we need to handle are:
    
     1. Given that AddressBook-Level4 is meant to be used by students as a
        base to build their own products, which may or may not be an address
        book app, we should be able to easily specify the site name that is
        displayed in the navigation bar.
    
        Solution: Teach the navigation bar to use the asciidoc attribute
        `site-name` as the site name.
    
     2. Not all documents may wish to have a navigation bar displayed at the
        top of their page.
    
        Solution: Teach the navigation bar to check if the asciidoc
        attribute `no-site-header` is set. If it is, then we don't render
        the navigation bar.
    
     3. The rendered documentation should be browsable locally. Thus, links
        in the navigation bar must be relative, and the proper relative
        links must be generated no matter how deep the documentation
        directory tree is.
    
        Solution: Introduce an asciidoc attribute `site-root`, which should
        store the absolute path of the root documentation directory. In
        other words, it should be the same as the `sourceDir` specified in
        build.gradle. This is used to workaround the fact that the
        asciidoctor gradle plugin only passes in individual filenames, and
        not the sourceDir, to asciidoctor.
    
        The navigation bar can then compare the current directory with the
        `site-root` directory, and use it to generate the correct relative
        paths.
    
     4. It looks nicer if the item that the reader is currently browsing is
        highlighted in the navigation bar. e.g. If the current page is the
        Developer Guide, the "Developer Guide" item will be highlighted in
        the navigation bar.
    
        This requirement is complicated by the fact that the "Developer
        Guide" actually comprises of many documents: UsingGradle, Using
        Travis, UsingAppVeyor etc.
    
        Solution: Teach the navigation bar to examine the `site-section`
        attribute of the document, and highlight the appropriate navigation
        item.
    
     5. The templating mechanism is extremely advanced and requires some
        knowledge of Ruby and Asciidoctor's API. Downstream projects may
        modify the template file, break it, and then file an issue expecting
        support from us.
    
        Solution: Explicitly state in the Developer Guide that we do not
        provide support for modified template files. If downstream projects
        break the files, they get to keep the pieces.
    
    Thanks to the additional configuration attributes that we have added,
    downstream projects will need to do more configuration to tweak the
    documentation settings to match their fork. Update the developer guide
    to mention this.

    docs/templates/_footer: fix condition for emitting <br>
    
    The footer has unnecessary empty vertical space.
    
    This is because if the `last-update-label` attribute is specified, an
    extra <br> is added, which is meant to separate the "Last updated" line
    from the document revision number line.
    
    However, if the document has no revision number, then it would seem that
    the footer has unnecessary empty vertical space.
    
    Fix this by only emitting the <br> if there is a revnumber AND a
    last-update-label.

    docs/templates: remind devs to restart the gradle daemon
    
    For the purpose of speed, the asciidoctor gradle plugin will "reuse the
    asciidoctor instance to avoid reinstantiating the jruby runtime"[1].
    
    This has the effect of keeping the old template files in memory, meaning
    that if the template files are modified while the gradle daemon is
    running, the changes won't be reflected in the running gradle daemon.
    The documentation will still use the old template even when the
    `asciidoctor` task is rerun.
    
    This optimization is however, still beneficial: developers are more
    likely to edit the documentation adoc files compared to modifying the
    template files. As such, they will benefit from the speed increase
    gained from keeping the template files in memory. Thus, we will not make
    any attempt to work around this.
    
    Instead, let's add a comment to the top of every template file,
    reminding developers that if they wish for their changes to the template
    files to be reflected in the generated HTML files, they will need to
    restart the Gradle daemon.

    docs/templates/helpers.rb: remove unused code
    
    In the previous commit, we imported helpers.rb, as well as other
    template files, from the asciidoctor-backends[1] repo.
    
    However, as we did not import all of the template files, some of the
    code in helpers.rb is unused.
    
    The unused code is an unnecessary maintenance and readability burden, so
    let's remove them.

    docs/templates: import asciidoctor reference template
    
    We are trying to implement a navigation bar in the SE-EDU website using
    asciidoctor's template mechanism[1].
    
    Asciidoctor's template mechanism works by allowing template developers
    to override the rendering of certain blocks in asciidoctor's syntax
    tree. For our case, if we want to add a navigation bar to the top of the
    page, we will need to override asciidoctor's `document` block handling.
    
    The problem is: the rendering logic for the document block itself is
    quite coarse -- covering everything from the header <meta> and <script>
    tags to the footer's "last updated" text. If we just want to add a
    navigation bar without changing the rest of the document's output, we
    will need to re-implement a large part of asciidoctor's HTML5 backend.
    
    Fortunately, the asciidoctor-backends[2] repository has done most of the
    hard work for us -- it features complete re-implementation of templates
    that mirror asciidoctor's default HTML5 output. By using these templates
    as a base, we can then make minimal changes on top to get our navigation
    bar.
    
    The asciidoctor-backends repo has templates for three different template
    engines: ERB, HAML and Slim. All three template engines are supported by
    the asciidoctor Gradle plugin, since AsciidoctorJ bundles them inside
    its JAR file[3].
    
    Following the recommendation of asciidoctor's project lead[4], let's use
    the Slim backend.
    
    Import the necessary template files, contained within the slim/html5/
    directory, from the latest commit
    (8ffcad1f9194fe2638f673aea7e41ed28c654800) of the asciidoctor-backends
    repo.
    
    Since we only need to modify the handling of the `document` block, we
    just need to import `document.html.slim`, as well as its dependencies.

    [4] https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-backends/issues/118#issuecomment-99609554
    
        "We should point out that ERB is complex and that, in our
        experience, the templates were exceptionally hard to maintain when
        done in ERB. In contrast, the templates are simple and clear when
        done in Slim and we have convenient facilities for simplifying the
        templates further with utility methods. Slim is a smarter
        engineering choice."

    In the upcoming commits, we will be adding a navigation bar to the
    SE-EDU website using asciidoctor's template mechanism[1].
    
    In preparation of that, let's teach the asciidoctor gradle plugin to

    Warn developers against using JDK 10 on Windows

    As such, let's warn developers against using JDK 10 on Windows in our

    Some developers who have both JDK 9 and JDK 10 installed on their

    ... and so forth
    
    According to a PR[1] on the JaCoCo's issue tracker, this occurs because
    "Classes of JDK 10 EA b35 use a new classfile version number and so
    JaCoCo Agent 0.7.9 as well as agent from current build of master branch
    fail to start". This has been fixed as of JaCoCo 0.8.1, which also
    happens to be the latest release.
    
    We do not explicitly specify the version JaCoCo to use in our
    build.gradle file, and so the `jacoco` gradle plugin just uses its
    default, which happens to be 0.8.0[2] on Gradle 4.6 (the version we are
    using). This version of JaCoCo still has this bug, and so we get these
    errors.
    
    Fix this by upgrading to the latest version of Gradle (4.8.1). Since
    Gradle 4.7[3] the default JaCoCo plugin has been upgraded to version
    0.8.1, and so upgrading to the latest version of Gradle will fix this
    problem and allow us to run tests on JDK 10.
    
    The Gradle wrapper upgrade was performed by running the command:
    
        ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 4.8.1
    
    and then converting the line endings of gradlew.bat to unix to satisfy
    our travis line ending checks.
    
    Also, update any references to the Gradle version we are using in the
    code base to 4.8.1.

    Fix stalling HelpWindowTest
    
    When running `gradlew headless allTests`, gradle will sometimes stall on
    HelpWindowTest.
    
    While we do not know the exact cause of this stalling, we have narrowed
    it down to the following conditions[1] which must all be present for the
    stalling to occur:
    
      1. The test must be running in headless mode.
    
      2. There must be two stages created, one with a WebView, and one with
         no scene.
    
      3. Both stages must be shown.
    
    Since it is pretty difficult and time-consuming to debug and find out
    the exact cause of this stalling, let's fix this issue by removing one
    of its trigger conditions.
    
    (1) obviously cannot be removed, since we want headless testing to work
    on our code. For (2), the HelpWindow needs to have a WebView to show the
    user guide, and so we can't remove the WebView.
    
    But really, stepping back a bit, we can see that the whole test setup
    which leads to (2) and (3) being present in the first place is pretty
    strange:
    
        // (a)
        guiRobot.interact(() -> helpWindow = new HelpWindow());
        // (b)
        Stage helpWindowStage = FxToolkit.setupStage((stage) -> stage.setScene(helpWindow.getRoot().getScene()));
        // (c)
        FxToolkit.showStage();
        helpWindowHandle = new HelpWindowHandle(helpWindowStage);
        [...]
        // (d)
        guiRobot.interact(helpWindow::show);
    
    In (a), we create an instance of HelpWindow, which has its own Stage
    which can be retrieved with HelpWindow#getRoot().
    
    However, in (b) we transfer the HelpWindow's scene to the TestFX's
    primary stage, leaving the helpWindow with no scene. But: there is no
    reason to use the TestFX's registered primary stage when HelpWindow
    already has its own Stage.
    
    And in (c), we show the TestFX primary stage, and then later in (d) we
    show the helpWindow. However, given that helpWindow does not have a
    scene and is thus not showing anything, it would be deceptive to use it
    for tests which are meant to verify that the application works
    correctly.
    
    As such, let's fix the stalling by fixing the root of the problem: the
    bogus test setup. Rather than having two stages, let's just use
    HelpWindow's stage directly for all tests, and register it as the TestFX
    primary stage using FxToolkit#registerStage(...). This has the effect of
    removing trigger conditions (2) and (3), since we now only have one
    Stage, thus fixing the stalling.
    
    NOTE: Even with this fix, focus_helpWindowNotFocused_focused() still
    cannot be run in headless mode, although for a different reason compared
    to when this skip was introduced in 2cf5b98 (HelpWindowTest: skip test
    with buggy behavior in headless mode, 2018-04-21). Now, this test will
    fail due to a different JavaFX bug[2]. Clarify this by adding comments
    explaining why the test is skipped in headless mode.

    HelpWindowTest: fix failing test in non-headless mode (#880)
    
    HelpWindowTest#focus_helpWindowNotFocused_focused() test checks that
    the HelpWindow#focus() method will cause the HelpWindow to be in focus
    when called. The test first asserts that the HelpWindow is not in focus
    first after it is shown, being calling this method and asserting that
    the HelpWindow is now in focus.
    
    When tests are run in non-headless mode, the HelpWindow will be in
    focus immediately after it is shown, thus our first assertion is
    incorrect, causing the test to consistently fail in non-headless mode.
    
    Let's add a method GuiRobot#removeFocus(), and update the test to call
    this method to remove focus from the HelpWindow after it is shown
    to ensure the first assertion is correct in non-headless mode.

    Our build.gradle configuration does not log to the console tests that
    were skipped. These tests may have been skipped for certain reasons,
    e.g. they do not support headless mode and should be run in
    non-headless mode instead.
    
    As these tests that are skipped may actually be failing, we should
    enable logging of these tests so that users know which tests needs
    to be tested separately.
    
    Lets update build.gradle to enable logging of tests that were skipped.

    HelpWindowTest: skip test with buggy behavior in headless mode
    
    HelpWindowTest#focus_helpWindowNotFocused_focused test checks
    whether calling HelpWindow#focus() will bring the HelpWindow to focus.
    Normally, when HelpWindow#show() is called, the HelpWindow's
    Stage should automatically be in focus.
    
    However, when tests are run in headless mode, the HelpWindow in
    HelpWindowTest#focus_helpWindowNotFocused_focused test does not
    automatically come into focus after it is shown.
    
    This is due to HelpWindowStage in setUp() setting the HelpWindow's
    Scene to itself. According to the JavaFx docs for
    Window#setScene(Scene)[1], a Scene can only be on one Stage at a time,
    and setting a Scene on a different Stage will cause the old Stage to
    lose the reference. As a result, the HelpWindow's Stage will not have a
    reference to any Scene, resulting in the HelpWindow's Stage not coming
    into focus automatically, due to a bug with Monocle's headless mode.
    
    Let's skip HelpWindowTest#focus_helpWindowNotFocused_focused test when
    tests are run in headless mode as it is relying on buggy behavior.

    HelpWindowTest: fix failing test in non-headless mode
    
    HelpWindowTest#focus_helpWindowNotFocused_focused() asserts that the
    HelpWindow is not in focus when it is first shown, and then asserts
    that the HelpWindow comes into focus after calling HelpWindow#focus().
    
    When tests are run in non-headless mode, the HelpWindow will be in
    focus when it is first shown, thus rendering our first assumption false
    and causing the test to fail.
    
    Let's update the test to focus on another TestFx Stage, which will
    remove focus from the HelpWindow when it is first shown, ensuring that
    the initial assumption is true.

    [#750] Use java.nio.file for file/path handling (#866)
    
    String operations are used for the construction of file paths. Also,
    many APIs in the codebase take in String arguments as file paths.
    
    This method of file/path handling is error prone as creating paths using
    string concatenation can lead to the creation of invalid paths.
    Furthermore, checking if two paths resolve to the same file using string
    equality is incorrect as it only tests if the strings are equal.
    
    Let's refactor the codebase to use java.nio.file for file/path
    handling as it provides a safe and platform-independent way to
    perform operations on paths and properly separate the concerns of
    parsing/stringifying paths and manipulating paths.

    MainApp: extract handling of application parameters into AppParameters
    
    The handling of application parameters is done in the MainApp.
    
    This decreases cohesiveness as handling and parsing of application
    parameters should be done separately and not in the MainApp as
    command-line parsing is at a much lower level compared to the high level
    setup of the application architecture. This also allows the parsing of
    application parameters to be tested independently.
    
    Let's extract the handling of application parameters from MainApp into

    which checks if all fields of the Person except tags are identical.
    
    Two Persons of the same name that have at least one other equivalent
    identity field (phone or email) but different data fields (address and/
    or tags), are considered different even though they are actually the
    same person.
    
    Let's add another equality method, Person#isSamePerson(Person), for
    performing comparisons between identity fields and use this equality
    check when adding or editing a person.

    Person: add an equality check for tags
    
    The equality methods that check for both identity and data fields,
    Person#equals(Object) and PersonCardHandle#equals(Person), checks if all
    fields of the Person except tags are identical.
    
    Since these methods check for the equality of both identity and data
    fields, it should test for the equality of all fields including tags.
    
    Let's add an equality check for tags in Person#equals(Object) and
    PersonCardHandle#equals(Person).
    
    Also, TypicalPersons#DANIEL now contains the "friends" tag while
    typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml#DANIEL does not. This causes the
    XmlSerializableAddressBookTest#toModelType_typicalPersonsFile_success
    test to fail. To prevent that, let's add the "friends" tag to
    typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml#DANIEL.

    Following this change, some tests throw DuplicatePersonException when
    they try to add the default person using PersonBuilder to a model that
    already contains TypicalPersons#ALICE. This is because the default
    person in PersonBuilder has the same values for the name and phone
    fields as ALICE. To prevent that, let's change the value of the phone
    field for ALICE.

    email. To prevent that, let's change the format of the name and phone
    creation such that each Person is unique.

    This method is only called by FindCommand.

    AddressBookParserTest#parseCommand_edit() uses
    PersonUtil#getPersonDetails(Person) to create the argument to be
    parsed by EditCommandParser. It then compares this with a newly
    constructed EditCommand. However, in the case where a Person is being

    not make a distinction between these two cases:
    1. The person originally has no tags.
    2. The person originally has tags, and we are clearing these tags.

    will only give us attributes for case 1 instead.

    Gradle: upgrade to JUnit5
    
    Gradle uses JUnit 4.12 for testing which is an older version of JUnit.
    
    Let's upgrade to JUnit 5. To use JUnit 5, we need to add in additional
    dependencies junit-jupiter-api and junit-jupiter-engine.
    Junit-jupiter-engine is used to execute the JUnit 5 tests during
    runtime, while junit-jupiter-api provides the api required for writing
    tests. Also, we need to use JUnit Platform, which is how Gradle
    enables JUnit to run tests using its engine.
    
    JUnit 5 has a few differences with JUnit 4, which means the tests will
    need to be changed to run on the JUnit 5 engine. Some examples of
    differences between JUnit5 and JUnit4 tests:
    1. Different imports. (e.g. org.junit.jupiter.api.Test instead of
    org.junit.Test)
    2. Test cannot be used for specifying expectations. We use this to
    specify timeout in `PersonListPanelTest`. Instead we should now use
    assertTimeoutPreemptively
    3. @Before is renamed to @BeforeEach
    4. @After is renamed to @AfterEach
    5. @BeforeClass is renamed to @BeforeAll
    6. @AfterClass is renamed to @AfterAll
    7. We can group assertions together using assertAll
    8. @Rule and @ClassRule are not used in JUnit5. Instead, we need to
    @ExtendWith, which generally requires creating an extension class.
    
    Let's enable legacy support for JUnit 4 tests. By adding
    junit-vintage-engine as a dependency, JUnit 4 tests can be run
    normally.

    [#796] PersonListPanel#personListView: revert type change (#818)
    
    personListView is of type ListView<PersonCard>. We use EasyBind library
    to map the Person objects to PersonCard objects. The mapping / applying
    of Function<? super F, ? extends E> occurs only when either get(int) or
    getRemoved() methods are called[1]; the creation of PersonCard objects
    occur only when either of these methods are called.
    
    The ClearCommand deletes all Person objects. When we have large number
    of persons and getRemoved() is called, all the corresponding cards
    will be created prior to them being removed. As creation of PersonCard
    objects are costly, the app slows down tremendously.
    
    Let's revert ListView<PersonCard> to ListView<Person>.
    PersonListViewCell will create the PersonCard object. According to
    javadoc for Cell that "it is not feasible to create an actual Cell for
    every single item in the control. We represent extremely large data
    sets using only very few Cells. Each Cell is "recycled", or reused."[2]
    A Cell is created for every row in the ListView that is displayed on
    the scene i.e. that is visible to the user, and additional Cells may be
    created for efficient scroll handling.[3] This implies that there will
    only be about 10 Cells at any point in time since the default screen
    size is only large enough to display 10 Cells. Therefore, there will

    PersonListPanel#personListView: revert type change
    
    personListView is of type ListView<PersonCard>. We use EasyBind library
    to map the Person objects to PersonCard objects. The mapping / applying
    of Function<? super F, ? extends E> occurs only when either get(int) or
    getRemoved() methods are called[1]; the creation of PersonCard objects
    occur only when either of these methods are called.
    
    The ClearCommand deletes all Person objects. When we have large number
    of persons and getRemoved() is called, all the corresponding cards
    will be created prior to them being removed. As creation of PersonCard
    objects are costly, the app slows down tremendously.
    
    Let's revert ListView<PersonCard> to ListView<Person>.
    PersonListViewCell will create the PersonCard object. According to
    javadoc for Cell that "it is not feasible to create an actual Cell for
    every single item in the control. We represent extremely large data
    sets using only very few Cells. Each Cell is "recycled", or reused."[2]
    A Cell is created for every row in the ListView that is displayed on
    the scene i.e. that is visible to the user, and additional Cells may be
    created for efficient scroll handling.[3] This implies that there will
    only be about 10 Cells at any point in time since the default screen
    size is only large enough to display 10 Cells. Therefore, there will
    only be about 10 PersonCard objects at any point. Creation of 10
    PersonCard objects is performed in negligible time, thus the app no
    longer slows down. This commit is performed by reverting from
    75cbfa3804ff365646e903514282d9313da4300e.

    PersonListPanelHandle#navigateToCard(Person): update logic
    
    navigateToCard(Person) navigates to the card containing the person
    passed in as parameter, and selects the card.
    
    The selection of the card is an unexpected behaviour as it is not
    clear from the naming of the method. Also, there’s no need for this
    method to select the card.
    
    Let’s update this method to no longer select the card that it navigates
    to.

    build.gradle: upgrade to use Java 9
    
    The project currently runs on Java 8.
    
    We should ensure compatibility with the latest public version as soon
    as it is out.
    
    Let's upgrade the project to run on Java 9 and update the documentation
    accordingly.
    
    Some of the properties in gradle.properties are no longer supported.
    As PermGen has been replaced with Metaspace, -XX:MaxPermSize=size has
    ceased support [1] and has been replaced with -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize [2].
    Also, -XX:CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled has been superseded by
    -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled and removed in JDK 9 [3][4].
    -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled however, is useless now. When PermGen was
    used previously, this command line argument ensured that PermGen was
    garbage collected [5]. However, Metaspace is automatically garbage
    collected [6], therefore there's no replacement for this argument.
    Let's remove or update these properties accordingly.
    
    Travis & AppVeyor are building the project using JDK 8. Since we are
    now running on Java 9, let's update them to build the project using
    JDK 9.
    
    To run tests using TestFX on Java 9, we have to update the dependencies
    in build.gradle. Let's update it according to TestFX's
    documentation [7].
    
    Java 9 introduces a module system, causing internal packages such as
    javax.* and com.sun.* packages to be inaccessible. As our project uses
    these packages, our code is no longer compilable. Let's update
    build.gradle to import these modules.

    this method can be found in the internal list.
    UniquePersonList#remove(Person) returns true if the person passed into

    UniquePersonList#remove(Person) to void.

    MainWindow.fxml: update onCloseRequest event to call handleExit()
    
    The MainWindow does not have an event handler to handle external
    requests (such as the close button or through the taskbar) to close
    the MainWindow.
    
    This may cause the app to not close properly since MainApp#stop() is
    not called as the ExitAppRequestEvent is not raised. MainApp#stop() is
    the method used to call Platform#exit() and System#exit(int) which
    closes our app and all remaining open windows. Thus, if MainApp#stop()
    is not called, the app may continue to run even after the MainWindow is
    closed, causing existing HelpWindows to remain open even when the user
    expects the app to stop.
    
    According to the life-cycle section in the documentation on JavaFX
    Application[1], the app will only finish and call MainApp#stop() when
    the app either calls Platform#exit() or when the last window has been
    closed. Thus, should there be any HelpWindows still opened, the app
    will continue running, causing those HelpWindows to remain open.
    
    Let's add an event handler for the onCloseRequest event in the root of
    MainWindow.fxml. This event will call MainWindow#handleExit(), which
    raises an ExitAppRequestEvent, when there is an external request to
    close the app.
    
    EmptyMainWindowHandle does not contain a close button, thus to test if
    an ExitAppRequestEvent was raised, we fire a
    WindowEvent#WINDOW_CLOSE_REQUEST event which will trigger the
    onCloseRequest event.

    of these fields is not safe as it may lead to NullPointerException.

    Assert#assertThrows(Class<? extends Throwable>, VoidCallable) is a test
    utility method that helps to test if certain method call throws the

    Some methods tested throws different instances of the same Exception
    class with different exception messages to indicate different errors.
    Thus there is a need for a stronger test to ensure we are testing for
    the correct Exception instance for these methods.
    
    Let's add an overloaded method
    assertThrows(Class, String, VoidCallable) which takes in an additional
    expectedMessage String parameter for an additional verification check
    of the exception message.

    HelpWindow: modify HelpWindow#show() to use Stage#show()
    
    opened by typing help in the command box. For instance, the command box
    does not display the result message of subsequent commands. However,
    this does not occur when opening the help window by pressing F1 or
    pressing help from the help menu.
    
    This occurs due to a combination of using the default Dispatcher used
    by the Guava EventBus system, Dispatcher#perThreadDispatchQueue(),
    along with calling Stage#showAndWait(). Calling Stage#showAndWait(),
    starts a nested event loop to handle subsequent JavaFX events. However,
    the default Dispatcher used by the EventBus does not allow nested
    callback invocations, and instead queues them to be invoked after the
    current invoked callback, the MainWindow#handleShowHelpEvent()
    completes. As such, EventBus events are queued up in the meantime
    resulting in the subscribers of these events having to wait until the
    nested event loop is terminated (i.e. when the callback completes,
    after the help window is closed.) And so, the UI components will only
    receive these events and therefore update after the help window is
    closed.
    
    However, in the case of pressing F1 or pressing help from the help menu,
    MainWindow#handleHelp() is called immediately without posting the
    MainWindow#handleShowHelpEvent(). Since this event never enters the
    EventBus's queue, the nested event loop started by Stage#showAndWait()
    does not block it and subsequent EventBus events get dispatched as
    usual.
    
    Let's replace Stage#showAndWait() with Stage#show(), so
    that there will be no entering of a nested loop and hence no blockage
    of the Guava EventBus system.
    
    Likewise, this could be fixed by using the Dispatcher#immediate()
    dispatcher instead of the default dispatcher used by the Guava EventBus
    system. However, replacing Stage#showAndWait() with Stage#show() is
    more suitable in this case as it is sufficient to show the help window
    instead of starting a nested event loop to handle subsequent JavaFX
    events while waiting for the help window to be closed.

    [#737] Issue with undo/redo and modifications to filtered lists (#792)
    
    EditCommand and DeleteCommand stores the target index of the person to edit
    or delete respectively.
    
    As a result, redoing of these index-based commands will be executed on the incorrect
    person due to different indexing in differing views.
    
    Let's update EditCommand and DeleteCommand to find and store the personToEdit
    or personToDelete respectively before it's first execution. This ensures that future
    execution of the same command will be on the correct person.

    [#733] BrowserPanel: load dummy page (#793)

    Also, this causes our tests to fail as the loaded web page will be

    can only add XmlAdaptedPerson and XmlAdaptedTag to itself through
    it's constructor, which takes a ReadOnlyAddressBook. The model Person's
    object fields prevent us from assigning illegal values through
    execution of the app. Thus, the only way we can assign XmlAdaptedPerson
    or XmlAdaptedTag with illegal values to XmlSerializableAddressBook is
    through creating a .xml file with these illegal values, and reading
    the .xml file using XmlUtil#getDataFromFile(File, Class).

    Person is mutable.
    
    This is bad as:
    1. It is easy to break invariants by mutating an existing object which
    we do not own.
    2. No code uses Person’s setter methods.
    
    By making Person immutable, we can make the following improvements:

    2. Remove the need for defensive copying of Person objects.

    Remove ReadOnlyPerson

    Person is already immutable. This removes the need for ReadOnlyPerson.
    
    Let's replace all instances of ReadOnlyPerson with Person.

    using your IDE's tooling if applicable. On Eclipse, you can press
    Ctrl + Shift + O to do so.
    
    Furthermore, in AddressBook#updatePerson(Person, Person), the code will
    not compile because a variable is re-defined. This will also need to be

    Person: Inline ReadOnlyPerson’s methods
    
    ReadOnlyPerson#isSameStateAs(ReadOnlyPerson) and
    ReadOnlyPerson#getAsText() are used by Person.
    
    In the next commit, we will be deleting ReadOnlyPerson. In preparation
    for that, let's inline these methods into Person.

    Person: Make immutable
    
    Person is mutable.
    
    This is bad as:
    1. It is easy to break invariants by mutating an existing object which
    we do not own.
    2. No code uses Person’s setter methods.
    
    By making Person immutable, we can make the following improvements
    in future commits:
    1. Simplify the class hierarchy as we no longer require ReadOnlyPerson.
    2. Remove the need for defensive copying of Person objects.
    
    Let’s make Person immutable.
    
    Also, let’s remove redundant test in PersonCardTest.
    
    PersonCardTest verifies that whenever a Person object (Model) is
    updated, the corresponding PersonCard (View) is updated as well.
    
    As we are making Person to be immutable, this test is no longer
    necessary.

    PersonBuilder: Update methods to not use Person’s setter methods
    
    PersonBuilder creates a Person object upon initialization, and uses
    Person’s setter methods to update the values of the Person object.
    
    As part of making Person to be immutable, let's update these methods
    to not use Person’s setter methods. Instead of having a field of type
    Person, PersonBuilder will have 5 fields of types Name, Phone, Email,
    Address & Set<Tag> to represent the values of the Person object that it
    is building.

    AddressBook#resetData(ReadOnlyAddressBook): Reorder logic
    
    resetData(...) performs the following operations in order:
    * Setting new values for UniquePersonList `persons` and UniqueTagList
    `tags`
    * Synchronizing the tags in `persons` with `tags`
    
    This order of execution requires Person to be mutable so that the tags
    in `persons` can be synchronized with `tags`.
    
    As part of making Person to be immutable, let's reorder the logic by
    performing the synchronization before setting new values for
    UniquePersonList `persons`.
    
    Also, let's update syncMasterTagListWith(Person) to take in a
    ReadOnlyPerson instead since we are making Person immutable and should
    no longer set a Person's tags. As a result,
    syncMasterTagListWith(Person) will have to return a Person object.
    Let's also update the method name and header comments to reflect these
    changes.

    Normally, the background of the PersonListPanel is gray in color.
    However, it changes to white color when no Person is listed.
    
    This does not fit the dark theme style of other parts of the Ui as the

    build.gradle: teach test tasks to work together
    
    The allTests, nonGuiTests, guiTests tasks are implemented as separate
    tasks which are unaware of whether each other is being run. This leads
    to strange behavior such as the following command which runs some tests
    multiple times:
    
        ./gradlew allTests nonGuiTests guiTests
    
    These tasks are also not integrated with the `test` task, which is
    provided by default by the `java` plugin. This is the de facto task for
    running tests, and is run by default by other commonly-used tasks such
    as `./gradlew check` and `./gradlew build`.
    
    Fix this by making all of these tasks aware of each other. The `test`
    task is configured to be *the* task that runs the tests, while the
    nonGuiTests and guiTests tasks are converted to dummy tasks which just
    serve to inform the `test` task of whether to run the GUI tests or not.
    
    Everything works as normal, except that now
    `./gradlew allTests nonGuiTests guiTests` will have the expected result
    of running all tests only once. Other task combinations, such as
    `./gradlew headless test` and `./gradlew headless check` now also have
    the correct behavior of running tests in headless mode.

    ParserUtil.parseName(String), ParserUtil.parsePhone(String), etc. throw
    checked IllegalValueExceptions, which leads to more verbose error
    handling code in EditPersonDescriptorBuilder.
    
    We can remove the error handling code by using the Name, Phone, etc
    constructors directly, since they throw unchecked exceptions on invalid
    input. The use of unchecked exceptions in test code is not a problem as
    they would be caught and reported by the test runner anyway.

    Remove unnecessary IllegalValueException catches and throws in code base
    
    In the previous commits, we have fixed up the Name, Email, Address and
    Tag classes to not throw the checked IllegalValueException any more.
    
    As a result of these changes, there are many other call sites in the
    code base which do not need to throw or catch IllegalValueException any
    more.  Let's clean up these call sites.

    Move Tag validation step from model to parser and storage layers
    
    The Tag(String) constructor validates the passed in tag String,
    throwing a checked IllegalValueException error if the input fails
    validation.
    
    However, according to our architecture, the model layer should only be
    concerned with the storage of data in memory. Any data which reaches the
    model layer should have already been validated. As such, if for any
    reason the input tag String fails validation in the model layer, it is
    most likely a programmer error, and a runtime exception should thus be
    thrown instead.
    
    Fix this by moving the input validation step, and the throwing of the
    checked IllegalValueException, from the Tag constructor to the parser
    and storage layers. The Tag constructor will instead use the
    checkArgument(...) helper function to verify the "valid tag format"
    precondition.
    
    While we are here, rename the argument `name` to the more descriptive
    `tagName`.

    Tag's constructor modifies the input string by trimming leading and

    TestUtil#assertThrows(...): support checked exceptions
    
    TestUtil#assertThrows(...) doesn't support functions which throw checked
    exceptions. For example,
    
        TestUtil.assertThrows(IllegalValueException.class, () -> { throw new IllegalValueException(""); });
    
    would not compile, with the compiler complaining with:
    
        error: unreported exception IllegalValueException; must be caught or declared to be thrown
    
    This is because assertThrows(...) takes in a Runnable, whose run()
    method does not have `throws Exception` declared.
    
    java.util.concurrent.Callable<V>, on the other hand, looks like what we
    want, as it is a functional interface whose call() method has
    `throws Exception` declared. Unfortunately, due to how Java's generics
    work, call() MUST return a value. This means we will need to tack on a
    `return null` at the end of our lambda bodies, which is too verbose. Not
    good.
    
    As such, let's define our own `VoidCallable` interface, and modify
    assertThrows(...) to take it. Like Callable<V>, VoidCallable#call method
    has `throws Exceptions` declared, so our lambdas passed to
    assertThrows(...) can throw checked exceptions.  Unlike Callable<V>, its
    call() method doesn't need to return a return value, allowing us to
    write succinct lambda expressions to pass to assertThrows(...).

    Correctly model the scene graph hierarchy of MainWindow and HelpWindow (#747)
    
    As their names suggest, the root object of MainWindow and HelpWindow
    should be their Stage. However, this is presently not so. The root
    object of MainWindow and HelpWindow are both Regions, and the Stage and
    Scene which they manage is sneakily handled in their constructors.
    
    This violates the architecture of the UiPart system, which dictates that
    the return value of UiPart#getRoot(), as well as the root node of the
    FXML file, should be the root object of the scene graph which the UiPart
    manages. This derivation from the architecture may confuse readers.
    
    Fix this by using the <fx:root> feature of FXML files to achieve the
    aforementioned proper UiPart structure. The user interface from the
    user's point of view does not change.

    HelpWindow: make its Stage the root object
    
    Readers would expect the root object of the UiPart `HelpWindow` to be
    its `Stage` window.  However, this is not so. The root object of
    `HelpWindow` is a `Region`, and the Stage and Scene which HelpWindow
    manages is sneakily handled inside the constructor.
    
    While this works, it goes against the architecture of the UiPart system,

    which the UiPart manages. This derivation from the architecture may

    Fix this by using the <fx:root> feature of FXML. This allows us to
    specify a javafx.stage.Stage as the root object of HelpWindow.fxml,
    while also allowing us to inject the Stage object at runtime when
    HelpWindow is constructed.
    
    While using <fx:root> is not strictly required in HelpWindow's case,
    this is done to be consistent with MainWindow, a similar UiPart which
    has a Stage as its root object.
    
    Likewise, just like MainWindow, introduce a HelpWindow(Stage)
    constructor which allows callers to pass in a Stage to use as its root
    object. To cater to the current use case where the HelpWindow is shown
    in a new Stage, introduce a HelpWindow() utility constructor which does
    the Stage construction for callers.

    MainWindow: make the primary Stage the root object
    
    Readers would expect the root object of the UiPart `MainWindow` to be
    its `Stage` window. However, this is not so. The root object of
    `MainWindow` is a `Region`, and the Stage and Scene which MainWindow
    manages is sneakily handled inside its constructor.
    
    While this works, it does against the architecture of the UiPart system,
    which dictates that the return value of UiPart#getRoot(), as well as the
    root node of the FXML file, should be the root object of the scene graph
    which the UiPart manages. This derivation from the architecture may
    confuse readers.
    
    At the same time, we can't directly specify a Stage as the root node
    inside the MainWindow.fxml file. This is because under the JavaFX
    architecture, we should use the "primary stage" which is created by the
    JavaFX framework, rather than constructing our own.
    
    Fix this by using the <fx:root> feature of FXML file. This allows us to
    specify a javafx.stage.Stage as the root object of MainWindow.fxml,
    while also allowing us to inject the "primary stage" object as the root
    at runtime when MainWindow is constructed.
    
    Note that with this change, MainWindow#setAccelerator(...) will now
    install an event filter on the primary stage. This could be problematic
    if the primary stage was somehow reused across applications, but
    fortunately in the previous commit we have already taken care of
    ensuring this is not possible.

    SystemTestSetupHelper: use a new primary stage for each application
    
    By default, with TestFX, the same primary stage is shared between all
    system tests.
    
    This could cause state leaks between tests. For example, if one system
    test adds an event filter to its primary stage, this event filter will
    be preserved throughout all the other system tests, causing incorrect
    behavior.
    
    While our application does not modify the primary stage in a way which
    breaks tests if the primary stage is reused, we would be doing some
    tweaks to the code base in the next commit which would cause this to
    happen.
    
    As such, let's preemptively fix this problem by creating a new primary
    stage every time SystemTestSetupHelper#setupApplication(...) is called.
    This is done by modifying it to call:
    
        FxToolkit.registerStage(Stage::new);
    
    Since the primary stage created by FxToolkit.registerPrimaryStage()
    isn't actually used in the system tests, let's fix up the javadocs in
    SystemTestSetupHelper to take account this new state of affairs.
    
    In addition, let's rename SystemTestSetupHelper#initializeStage() to
    SystemTestSetupHelper#initialize() since its main purpose now isn't to
    create the "primary stage", but to call TestFX's initialization
    routines[1].
    
    [1] FxToolkit.registerPrimaryStage() will still need to be called even
        though the primary stage it creates is not used in tests.
        This is because, despite what its name implies, it actually does
        much more than just "creating the primary stage": it sets up JavaFX
        for headless testing and prevents JavaFX from shutting down when the
        last stage is hidden.

    UiPart: allow callers to specify the scenegraph root
    
    FXML files may wish to use the <fx:root> feature[1] where, rather than
    the FXML file specifying and creating the root object, a placeholder
    "root" is used instead which can then be specified when the FXML is
    loaded. This is useful in situations where we wish to use a preexisting
    object as the root.
    
    However, UiPart doesn't provide a way for callers to specify the root
    object, and thus the <fx:root> feature cannot be used.
    
    Fix this by introducing UiPart(URL, T) and UiPart(String, T)
    constructors which are similar to UiPart(URL) and UiPart(String), but
    allows callers to specify the root object to be used. This requires us
    to extract out some utility methods to share common functionality
    between these constructors.
    
    The next few commits will take advantage of this new feature.

    instead, which kicks in when we switch to using the proper syntax for
    figure captions -- by defining the caption text as the title of the
    block image[1].
    
    As a side benefit of using the figure caption syntax, we can now also
    use the cross reference syntax to reference other figures, which will
    give us the desired behavior of referencing that figure with the correct
    figure number.
    
    One downside of this approach is that the automatic figure numbers are
    not hierarchical, i.e. they just go 1, 2, 3... without taking the
    section numbers into account. However, the upside of not having to
    manually update figure numbers is much more valuable.

    DeveloperGuide, UserGuide: use cross references instead of manual links
    
    The UserGuide and DeveloperGuide contains many links to other sections
    in the document. However, these links are written using the link: syntax
    rather than using the cross reference syntax.
    
    In many cases, the link text simply repeats the title of the referenced
    section. Such uses result in unnecessary verbosity, and are also fragile
    since someone who modifies the title of the referenced section could
    easily forget to change the link text of links referencing that section
    as well.
    
    Let's fix this by changing the links to use the cross reference syntax
    instead, which provide automatic link text, so we do not need to repeat
    the section titles.
    
    If the anchor IDs of the referenced sections change, it would lead to
    dead links as well. As such, let's also give the referenced sections
    explicit anchor IDs to make sure they do not change.

    DeveloperGuide, UserGuide: use full xrefstyle
    
    By default, the cross-reference text when cross-referencing another
    section, figure, table etc. will be the title of that section, figure,
    table etc.
    
    For example, the following cross-reference in the DeveloperGuide:
    
        <<architecture>>
    
    will be replaced with:
    
        Architecture
    
    which is the name of that section.
    
    However, in a printed or non-interactive medium, cross-reference
    hyperlinks do not work. As such, it would be more useful to provide the
    section/figure/table number as well, so that readers will be able to
    quickly locate the reference target by its number, rather than needing
    to manually find its name in the document.
    
    As such, lets set the xrefstyle of the UserGuide and DeveloperGuide to
    `full`. With this change, the <<architecture>> cross-reference would be
    replaced with:
    
        Section 2.1, "Architecture"
    
    As the xrefstyle feature[1] was only introduced in asciidoctor 1.5.6[2],
    we'll need to upgrade our asciidoctor plugin as well.

    docs: remove env-github outfilesuffix boilerplate
    
    Many of our adoc files have the following boilerplate:
    
        ifdef::env-github,env-browser[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]
    
    This boilerplate used to be required in order for inter-document cross
    references to work when viewing the adoc files directly on GitHub. This
    was because GitHub errnously set the outfilesuffix as `.html` instead of
    `.adoc`, which resulted in broken links.
    
    However, as the asciidoctor user guide[1] states:
    
        This configuration is no longer necessary on GitHub since GitHub now
        sets the value of outfilesuffix to match the file extension of the
        source file. However, it’s still required in GitHub-like
        environments such as GitLab.
    
    Indeed, this seems to be the case on GitHub. As our project is unlikely
    to be hosted on other "GitHub-like environments such as GitLab" in the
    near future, let's remove this boilerplate.

    build.gradle: remove `forkEvery = 1`
    
    Setting `forkEvery = 1` has the effect of restarting the Java process
    for every test class run. As the JVM takes a long time to start up, this
    ends up making our test execution time unnecessarily long.
    
    As there doesn't seem to be a reason for why forkEvery has to be set to
    1, let's remove the setting. This will leave it at its default setting
    of zero, which means "don't restart the Java process at all".
    
    This significantly speeds up test execution. e.g. On my box,
    `./gradlew headless allTests` now takes only around a minute to run,
    compared to around 3 minutes before.

    build.gradle: remove project.ext block
    
    The only project property inside, `libDir`, is not used in the build
    script at all.
    
    It is also unlikely that we would be using project properties in the
    future. They are only required when we have multi-project build, and the
    root project needs to share properties with its child projects[1]. In
    most other cases, local variables, scoped to the location where they are
    meaningful, would be more appropriate.
    
    To simplify the build.gradle script, let's remove the project.ext block.

    build.gradle: standardize dependency specifications code style
    
    There are different styles of specifying dependencies in the
    build.gradle file, so let's standardize all of them into one single
    style.
    
    This style is chosen as it makes the groupId, artifactId, and version of
    the dependency obvious.
    
    Rather than defining the dependency versions as project.ext properties,
    just define them directly in the dependencies block so that the
    dependency version number is immediately obvious. An exception is made
    for the testfx dependencies since their version numbers are shared --
    use a local variable (since its only locally used) to define that
    instead.

    DeveloperGuide: use labeled list for glossary
    
    The glossary uses literal blocks for formatting definitions, which looks

    being chopped into two separate labeled lists with one item each.

    check-eof-newline: handle filenames with spaces
    
    check-eof-newline.sh doesn't properly handle filenames with spaces,
    instead treating them as multiple files instead.
    
    For example, we can create a file whose name has spaces, e.g.
    'filename with spaces.txt'. Ensure that the file has some content inside
    so that Git will detect it as a text file so it will be checked by
    check-eof-newline.sh:
    
        echo 'content' >'filename with spaces.txt'
    
    Then use git-add to track the file:
    
        git add 'filename with spaces.txt'
    
    Then run check-eof-newline.sh:
    
        ./config/travis/check-eof-newline.sh
    
    check-eof-newline.sh will then spew out the following errors:
    
        tail: cannot open './filename' for reading: No such file or directory
        tail: cannot open './with' for reading: No such file or directory
        tail: cannot open './spaces.txt' for reading: No such file or directory
    
    While this won't cause check-eof-newline.sh to error out (it will simply
    ignore those bogus filenames), it is still incorrect behavior since the
    file 'filename with spaces.txt' doesn't actually get checked by the
    script.
    
    This happens because when check-eof-newline.sh is reading the list of
    filenames from git-grep, the IFS variable is not set, and thus the shell
    will split the lines of filenames on <space>, <tab> and <newline>,
    resulting in filenames with spaces getting split into multiple
    filenames.
    
    Fix this by explicitly setting the IFS variable to <newline> before
    reading from git-grep, so that the lines of filenames will only be split
    on newline boundaries -- filenames with spaces will be preserved.
    
    See http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_05_03
    for more info on the IFS variable.

    SelectCommandSystemTest: Segment test cases
    
    There are many tests cases in the test method.
    
    Without segmenting the tests, it is harder for future readers to know
    what we are testing.
    
    Let’s segment the test cases to improve readability of the test cases.

    build.gradle: upgrade TestFX to 4.0.7-alpha
    
    TestFX 4.0.7-alpha has been released. Besides being the latest and
    greatest version, 4.0.7-alpha also contains a proper working headless
    mode for Linux.
    
    Without this upgrade, attempting to run `./gradlew headless guiTests` on
    Linux would result with the GUI tests failing with the following
    exception:
    
            java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.IllegalAccessException: Class org.testfx.toolkit.impl.ApplicationLauncherImpl can not access a member of class com.sun.glass.ui.monocle.HeadlessPlatform with modifiers ""
    
                Caused by:
                java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.IllegalAccessException: Class org.testfx.toolkit.impl.ApplicationLauncherImpl can not access a member of class com.sun.glass.ui.monocle.HeadlessPlatform with modifiers ""
    
                    Caused by:

    Let's upgrade TestFX to 4.0.7-alpha to have happy Linux developers.
    
    This working headless mode was also present in the 4.0.6-alpha, but we
    couldn't upgrade to it as it broke our gui tests. (See e1eafd1 ([#353]
    All gui tests are failing  (#354), 2017-03-23))
    
    Furthermore, since headless mode now works on Linux, our Travis CI
    builds do not need to run xvfb any more. As such, let's remove its usage
    from .travis.yml.

    HelpWindowTest fails on certain computers. The cursor does not move to

    This causes the wrong UI component to be in focus, which leads to a
    test failure.

    [#675] GuiUnitTest: Clears subscribers from EventsCenter after each test (#697)
    
    EventsCenter is a Singleton object, which is a possible cause of state
    leaks between tests as the state of the static objects are preserved
    across tests.
    
    EventsCenter isn’t cleared after each GuiUnitTest is executed, as such
    it stores a reference to its’ subscribers, which causes these objects
    to not be removed by Garbage Collection after the test is done
    executing. This causes AddCommandTest to fail when run locally on
    IntelliJ together with other tests.
    
    Let’s update GuiUnitTest to clears subscribers from EventsCenter after
    each test.
    
    Credits of debugging this issue goes to @pyokagan.

    DeleteCommandSystemTest: Rename variable commandToRun to command
    
    assertCommandSuccess(...) and assertCommandFailure(...) takes in a
    String named commandToRun.
    
    This variable is unnecessarily long; naming it as command is
    sufficiently descriptive.
    
    Let's update commandToRun to command.

    [#319] Checkstyle: enforce single statement per line (#669)
    
    It's difficult to read multiple statements on a single line. Also,
    single statement per line means fewer merge conflicts to clean up.
    
    Let's teach Checkstyle to enforce the rules OneStatementPerLine to
    maintain the single line statements practice in our code.

    Let's update these helper methods to throw unchecked Exceptions

    If tests call methods in the main code base that throw checked
    exceptions, they do not have to wrap the code around a try-catch block
    to rethrow an unchecked exception. This is because it makes the code
    unnecessarily longer. The purpose of this PR is to stop the throwing
    of checked exceptions from propagating, causing the tests and helper
    methods to need to throw them as well.

    AddressBookSystemTest: Update application’s clock on command execution
    
    Test classes have to update the application’s clock after each command
    has been executed. In DeleteCommandSystemTest, the update is called in
    both assertCommandSuccess(...) and assertCommandFailure(...).
    
    This leads to a lot of code repetition when other system tests are
    implemented, as they will have to update the clock in their own
    implementations of assertCommandSuccess(...) and
    assertCommandFailure(...).
    
    Let’s update executeCommand(String) to update the application’s clock
    immediately before a command is executed so that test classes do not
    have to update it.

    AddressBookSystemTest: Add missing wait for browser to load
    
    When TestApp is initialised, the default browser url page is loaded.
    
    There is no wait to ensure that this page is loaded before
    assertApplicationStartingStateIsCorrect() is called. This causes a race
    condition: if the page has not been successfully loaded before
    assertApplicationStartingStateIsCorrect(), this assertion method will
    fail.
    
    Let's teach AddressBookSystemTest to wait for the browser to load
    before calling assertApplicationStartingStateIsCorrect().

    AddressBookSystemTest: Wait for browser to load after command execution
    
    Test classes have to call
    WebViewUtil#waitUntilBrowserLoaded(BrowserPanelHandle) whenever a
    command that causes the browser to load a new page is executed.
    
    This causes code repetition when other test classes are implemented.
    
    Let’s shift this method call to executeCommand(String), so that this
    method only returns after the browser has loaded.
    
    Also, let’s enhance the concurrency check so that
    WebViewUtil#waitUntilBrowserLoaded(BrowserPanelHandle) does not have to
    manually reset the boolean concurrency variable.

    TestApp#getModel(): Return actual model
    
    This method returns a defensive copy of the model.
    
    This isn’t an exact copy of the model as the ModelManager’s constructor
    initialises the FilteredList to show all persons, even though the
    original model’s FilteredList may not be showing all persons.
    
    As there is no way to make a defensive copy of the model, let’s return
    the original model instead.

    AddressBookSystemTest: Add test verification helper method
    
    The browser panel is only updated if and only if the selected card in

    It is unnecessarily tedious for test classes to call both methods
    separately to check that both the browser panel and the person list

    call the relevant methods in BrowserPanelHandle and

    ClockRule: Improve verification
    
    ClockRule only injects a fixed clock at the start of each test method.
    Some test methods do multiple tests i.e. execute multiple commands,
    which implies that the status bar's timing is always being verified
    with the same timing.
    
    This causes the testing of the status bar's timing to be insufficient
    as we are only effectively testing that the first test updates the
    status bar's timing correctly.
    
    Let's add a method in ClockRule that updates the injected clock to the
    current time, and let's teach DeleteCommandSystemTest to call this
    method whenever a test is executed.

    TypicalPersons: Update getTypicalPersons()’s return type
    
    getTypicalPersons() return an array of ReadOnlyPerson.
    
    Some callers require the values to be stored in a List instead of an
    array. As such, they have to manually convert it to a List.

    getTypicalAddressBook() and loadAddressBookWithSampleData(AddressBook)
    are similar methods. The former returns an AddressBook with the content
    of the preset Persons in TypicalPersons, while the latter appends the
    content of the preset Persons into the original content of the
    AddressBook passed in.

    getHandleToSelectedCard() is a test method that returns an
    Optional<PersonCardHandle>. If no card is selected, it returns an
    Optional#empty().
    
    Since it is a test method, we expect callers to only call it when a card
    is selected. As such, we do not need to account for the case when no
    cards are selected.
    
    Let’s update the return type of getHandleToSelectedCard() to

    automatically call saveAddressBookSnapshot() when execute() is called
    to facilitate the undo redo mechanism. Classes that inherits from
    UndoableCommand will have to override executeUndoableCommand() instead

    [#459] Remove unnecessary pauses after pressing keys with GuiRobot (#572)
    
    guiRobot#type(...) and guiRobot#push(...) internally pauses after
    pressing the given keys.
    
    We do not need to call guiRobot#pauseForHuman() ourselves after calling
    these two key pressing methods.
    
    Let's remove the redundant guiRobot#pauseForHuman() calls.

    [#295] Clean up TestUtil (#560)
    
    TestUtil is a class with low cohesion as it contains methods that
    are unrelated to each other.
    
    This breaks the Single Responsibility Principle, whereby each class
    is supposed to have only one responsibility.
    
    Let's split up the methods into different classes to improve the
    cohesion of TestUtil. Also, let's do a general cleanup of TestUtil
    by removing unused methods etc.

    TestUtil contains assertThrows(...) and

    generateSamplePersonData() returns a List of 8 Person objects. This

    is used.
    
    There is no need to create 8 Person objects when only the first person
    is used. Furthermore, TypicalPersons also provides a List of Person
    objects for purposes of testing, thus this portion of code in TestUtil
    is duplicate code as well.

    object. This causes generateSamplePersonData to be unused, let’s remove

    [#292] Make ReadOnlyPerson observable (#552)
    
    ReadOnlyPerson is not observable. Whenever a ReadOnlyPerson is added
    or updated, PersonListPanel creates a new PersonCard and initialises
    it with the ReadOnlyPerson's details.
    
    This is inefficient as multiple cards have to be deleted and
    re-created whenever a ReadOnlyPerson is updated. Also, there is an
    additional call to set the ReadOnlyPerson in the list of PersonCards
    to update the view i.e updating the ReadOnlyPerson does not
    automatically update the view.
    
    Let's update ReadOnlyPerson to be observable and teach PersonCard
    to bind its view to the ReadOnlyPerson objects so that whenever they
    are updated, the view is automatically updated. As such, the cards
    do not need to be deleted and re-created.

    [#557] ParserUtil: Update header comments on Optional usage (#558)
    
    ParserUtil#parseX(Optional) methods currently take in an Optional.
    
    This violates the usage of Java Optional. However, the methods in
    concern receive {@code Optional} return values from other methods as
    parameters and return {@code Optional} values based on whether the
    parameters were present. Therefore, it is redundant to unwrap the
    initial {@code Optional} before passing to {@code ParserUtil} as a
    parameter and then re-wrap it into an {@code Optional} return value
    inside {@code ParserUtil} methods.

    developers why ParserUtil takes in Optional even though it violates

    [#459] Add NodeHandle and WindowHandle (#522)
    
    GuiHandle is a messy class. It has no proper encapsulation as it can
    access all nodes in the scene graph. It is also not very cohesive, as
    it handles interactions with text fields, labels and windows.
    
    Let's create NodeHandle, which points to a Node in the scene graph
    (usually used to point to a compoent), and StageHandle, which points
    to a Stage in the scene graph. NodeHandle and StageHandle will be the
    substitute to GuiHandle. Let's also port all our component handles to
    use the new NodeHandle and StageHandle.

    [#539] Clean up UniqueTagList (#540)
    
    UniqueTagList has 2 overloaded methods to set tags:
    setTags(UniqueTagList) and setTags(Collection).
    
    Person#setTags(Set) constructs a UniqueTagList from the set of tags
    passed in. It then calls UniqueTagList#setTags(UniqueTagList),
    which then calls setAll(UniqueTagList#internalList).
    
    This makes the construction of UniqueTagList unnecessary as no
    other properties of UniqueTagList are required here.
    
    Also, AddressBook#resetData(ReadOnlyAddressBook) calls
    setTags(Collection), followed by a catch clause asserting that
    AddressBooks should not have duplicate tags.
    
    This makes the code unnecessarily long as there is a try-catch
    block, where the catch block does not do anything significant.
    
    Let’s replace these methods with UniqueTagList#setTags(Set<Tag>).
    Person#setTags(Set<Tag>) will not need to construct a UniqueTagList,
    and AddressBook#resetData(ReadOnlyAddressBook) will not need to
    catch the DuplicateTagException as there are no duplicate tags in a
    Set.

    PersonListPanelHandle: Remove unnecessary pre-condition check
    
    PersonListPanelHandle#getPersonCardHandle(ReadOnlyPerson) checks that
    the ReadOnlyPerson is in the list, and throws PersonNotFoundException if
    it isn't.
    
    We can safely assume that if the card is not found, then the person
    cannot exist in the list. The converse is also true (i.e. if the person
    is not in the list, then the corresponding card cannot exist).

    to all components.
    
    Let's also create StageHandle, which points to a Stage in the scene
    graph. It will also be capable of stage interactions, and obtaining
    the nodes within the Stage to allow us to create NodeHandles.
    
    As a result of creating NodeHandle and StageHandle, GuiHandle should no

    the header comments to mention about the new classes.

    AddressBook: Modify setTags(Collection<Tag>) to setTags(Set<Tag>)
    
    AddressBook#resetData(ReadOnlyAddressBook) calls setTags(Collection),
    followed by a catch clause asserting that AddressBooks should not
    have duplicate tags.
    
    This makes the code unnecessarily long as there is a try-catch
    block, where the catch block does not do anything significant.
    
    Let's modify setTags(Collection) to take in a Set instead. This
    method will call UniqueTagList#setTags(Set), which does not throw
    DuplicateTagException. Thus, this eliminates the need to catch it
    in AddressBook#setTags(Set), thus removing the unnecessary assertion.

    UniqueTagList: Modify setTags(UniqueTagList) to setTags(Set<Tag>)
    
    Person#setTags(Set) constructs a UniqueTagList from the set of tags
    passed in. It then calls UniqueTagList#setTags(UniqueTagList),
    which then calls setAll(UniqueTagList#internalList).
    
    This makes the construction of UniqueTagList unnecessary as no
    other properties of UniqueTagList are required here.
    
    Let’s teach UniqueTagList#setTags(UniqueTagList) to take in Set
    instead, to avoid the unnecessary construction of UniqueTagList.

    Add ListElementPointer
    
    The native ListIterator’s cursor does not point to an element.
    Rather, it points in between elements. As a result, alternating
    calls of ListIterator#next() and ListIterator#previous() return
    the same element.
    
    This behaviour is not suitable for implementing the functionality
    of allowing up and down buttons to return the previous and next
    input respectively.
    
    As a step towards allowing up and down buttons to get previous and
    next input respectively, let’s create ListElementPointer.
    ListElementPointer has an index that works as a pointer to an element
    in the list. This allows us to iterate through the list while
    providing better code clarity.
    
    We have tried to create a class that wraps around ListIterator, but
    it does not work well because the cursor still does not point to an
    element.
    
    Also, we have tried to create a PeekingListIterator(an extension
    of PeekingIterator [1]), in which we use peekNext() and peekPrevious()
    to get the next and previous elements accordingly. One of the ways
    is to override the next() and previous() methods such that they do
    not return anything. However, this would violate the Iterator’s
    semantics. Another way is to not override both methods, and simply
    ignore the return values i.e we only access the next and previous
    elements by using peekNext() and peekPrevious() respectively.
    However, this isn’t intuitive to future developers who may wonder
    why we are ignoring the return values.

    build.gradle: Add 'seedu/address/ui/' as part of guiTests
    
    Our GUI unit tests are located in 'seedu/address/ui/'.
    
    This is not configured in our build.gradle, thus our GUI unit tests will
    not run when running the task 'guiTests'.
    
    Let's add 'seedu/address/ui/' as one of the test paths for 'guiTests'
    task, so that our GUI unit tests will run as well.

    Add PersonCardTest
    
    The GUI tests are system tests.
    
    The individual GUIs do not have unit tests.
    
    Let's add a PersonCardTest to unit test the PersonCard GUI component.
    
    An alternative method of checking the labels would be to use
    reflections. However, reflections are not suitable for level 4
    learning objectives.

    EventsCollector: Add getMostRecent()
    
    StorageManagerTest uses EventsCollector. It is only interested in
    testing the most recent event that has occurred.
    
    The test gets the first event from the EventsCollector's List as it
    assumes that is the most recent event. That assumption may not always
    be true.
    
    Let's add EventsCollector#getMostRecent() that retrieves the most recent
    event, and teach StorageManagerTest to call that instead.

    [#502] Revamp sleep() for Gui tests (#503)
    
    The current uses of `guiRobot.sleep()` in our gui tests can be
    categorized into two groups:
    
      (A) To prevent the tests from executing too fast, as that prevents us
          from visually examining the progression of the test.
    
      (B) To wait for something to happen on the JavaFX Application thread.
    
    Both types of uses of `guiRobot.sleep()` are undesirable. Group (A)
    unfairly makes our GUI tests slower in headless mode, as in headless
    mode we can't visually examine GUI test progression anyway. Group (B)
    is wrong and can lead to flaky tests, as sleeping for a set amount of
    time does not guarantee that what we are waiting for actually occurs on
    the JavaFX Application thread.
    
    Let's
    - Add GuiRobot#pauseForHuman() (for group A) for pauses that are merely
      for human observations. We are able to disable these pauses in
      headless mode.
    - Add guiRobot.waitForEvent() (for group B) with incremental waits, so
      that we are able to wait for events in JavaFX Application thread,
      instead of waiting for a fixed interval and assuming that the events
      happened.

    GuiRobot#pauseForHuman(int): Remove duration parameter
    
    Some events are easy to examine and require less time for pausing, while
    other events require more human processing time. Therefore, the tests
    require different values of time to sleep.
    
    However, this makes it difficult to use GuiRobot#pauseForHuman(int) as
    developers need to determine the desirable waiting time.
    
    Let's remove the duration parameter, and standardise the waiting time
    to be 250ms, which is sufficient for events that require more human
    processing time.

    ErrorDialogGuiTest: Implement smart wait for showErrorDialogs()
    
    ErrorDialogGuiTest#showErrorDialogs() posts a 'DataSavingExceptionEvent'.
    This event is caught by the GUI, which launches an Alert dialog box.
    
    The GUI launches the dialog box, waits for 1000ms, and assumes that the
    dialog box is open after 1000ms. The delay does not guarantee that the
    Alert dialog box is actually opened after 1000ms has passed.
    
    Let's add guiRobot.waitForEvent() to add incremental wait, and also ensure
    that the Alert dialog box is actually opened before proceeding. It will
    also fail if our wait becomes too long.

    [#448] ui: Remove bidirectional dependencies in UiParts (#497)

    to add themselves into the placeholder. Therefore the placeholder acts

    BrowserPanel: Remove placeholder from constructor
    
    The components accept a placeholder in their constructor in order for
    them to add themselves into the placeholder. Therefore the placeholder
    acts like a parent to the component.
    
    The components themselves should not know about their parent placeholder
    as this creates a bi-directional dependency coupling.
    
    Let's remove the placeholder parameter in BrowserPanel's constructor, and

    PersonListPanel: Fix SplitPane.resizableWithParent not working
    
    PersonListPanel should not resize when the MainWindow is being resized.
    This is accomplished by setting the SplitPane.resizableWithParent
    attribute to false.
    
    The attribute is set inside the PersonListPanel's placeholder, but the
    placeholder is enclosed inside a VBox element. Therefore, when the user
    resizes the window, the SplitPane is still able to resize the VBox,
    which in turn resizes the placeholder. This behavior overrides the
    attribute.
    
    Let's set the SplitPane.resizableWithParent attribute in the VBox
    element, so that the VBox element cannot be resized by the window, which
    in turn prevents the placeholder from resizing as well.

    [#439] Allow user to see the command history (#440)
    
    AddressBook does not keep track of entered commands.
    
    This makes it difficult for the user to trace commands entered
    previously. In addition, users have to type out the whole command again
    should they make a small typo in their commands previously.
    
    Let’s implement the History functionality to allow the user to access
    previously entered commands in the GUI.

    [#401] Create unit tests for ParserUtil#splitPreamble() (#424)
    
    ParserUtil#split() has no unit test.
    
    It exhibits undesirable behaviours such as not properly splitting the
    string when there are leading and trailing white spaces. For example,
    the string " abc def" will be split into: an empty string and "abc def",
    instead of two strings "abc" and "def". It also allows the method to be
    called when there are fewer than 2 parts.
    
    Let's fix those issues and create unit tests for the method.

    ParserUtil#split(String, int): Trim whitespace
    
    If there are leading whitespace characters in the string, the first
    field will be an empty string after splitting.
    
    This may cause unexpected behaviour when splitting the string.
    For example, the string " abc def" will be split into: an empty string
    and "abc def", instead of two strings "abc" and "def".
    
    Let's trim the whitespace in the string before splitting it so
    that this behaviour can be avoided.

    [#438] Create a new Index class (#447)
    
    The usages of zero-based indices and one-based indices are mixed
    throughout the codebase. Both uses int, and are only differentiated by
    different suffixes for the variable names (e.g int zeroBasedIndex,
    int oneBasedIndex).
    
    The index base can be easily confused and is prone to error. The
    conversion also takes place at different areas of the codebase and is
    not consistent.
    
    Let's create an Index class that understands how to convert to a
    both zero-based and one-based index, and update the codebase to use
    Index instead of int when handling user inputs.
    
    Index from the point when a new user input is being parsed, so that if
    the current component wants to communicate with another component, it
    can send an Index to avoid having to know what base the other component
    is using for its index. However, after receiving the Index, that
    component can convert it back to an int if the index will not be passed
    to a different component again.

    [#305] Command parsers: use exceptions for error handling (#333)
    
    All CommandParser#parse(String) return a generic Command type, instead
    of the specific command that they are tasked to parse (for example,

    This is because the methods might also return an IncorrectCommand if it
    encounters a parse error. This causes an unnecessary loss of specificity
    in the return value type if the parsing is successful (e.g. receiving a
    Command object instead of an AddCommand object), and in the error info
    if the parsing failed (e.g. receiving an IncorrectCommand instead of a
    specific Exception object containing the exact stack trace).

    [#433] GuiHandle#setTextField(String, String) should call Gui methods on JavaFx threads (#434)
    
    On some computers, GuiHandle#setTextField() throws an
    IllegalStateException, indicating that the methods called in
    GuiHandle#setTextField() should have been executed on the JavaFx Gui
    thread.
    
    Let's fix GuiHandle#setTextField() to call Gui modification methods

    [#311] AddressBook#addPerson() does not copy the Person (#313)
    
    When accepting a new Person, both UniquePersonList and AddressBook
    insert the original object, rather than a copy of the object.
    
    Outside classes are able to indirectly modify the list by using the
    same object after inserting them into the list. This is undesirable as
    UniquePersonList and AddressBook cannot guarantee that the constraints,
    such as the uniqueness of the list, continue to hold, which results in
    incorrect behavior for both classes.
    
    Let's ensure that UniquePersonList and AddressBook are actually storing
    copies of the Person object, rather than the original object, so that
    outside classes are not able to modify them after it is inserted into
    the list or book.

    [#319] Checkstyle: enforce operators' placement in line wraps (#382)
    
    Our coding standard for Java requires operators' placement in line
    wraps to follow specific rules, such as having assignment operator (=)
    stay attached to the token that precedes it and having the arithmetric
    operator (+) in a new line. These rules are not enforced by
    checkstyle.
    
    Let's teach Checkstyle to be stricter about line wrapping around more
    symbols by adding the relevant OperatorWrap rules.

    [#309] Use StackPanes for holding UiParts (#405)
    
    MainWindow uses AnchorPanes as a placeholder for UiParts. AnchorPane's
    default behavior does not make its children fill up the entire space,
    thus we have to manually call FxViewUtil#applyAnchorBoundaryParameters()
    to do so.
    
    StackPane's default behavior fills up the entire placeholder space
    automatically.
    
    Let's
      - replace the usage of AnchorPane with StackPane.
      - remove FxViewUtil#applyAnchorBoundaryParameters(), since we no
        longer have to manually fill up the entire space.

    [#406] Teach Parser to enforce spaces between arguments (#409)
    
    Our parser does not enforce a space between consecutive arguments.
    For example: “add ABC a/ValidAddressp/61356436e/abc@email.com
    t/someTag” is able to create a correct person.
    
    This is undesirable because,
    1. it makes the command harder to read (prefixes are harder to detect
    by the naked eye).
    2. it limits our choices for future implementations of prefixes.
    For example, if we want to create a new prefix sp/, the input above
    would be ambiguous because we do not know whether the user meant
    sp/ or p/.
    
    Let’s teach Parser to enforce spaces between fields.

    UniquePersonList#add(Person) directly inserts the input Person object

    This makes it possible for outside classes to indirectly modify Person

    Prefix: add toString()
    
    Concatenating a command prefix when constructing a command string
    requires the use of Prefix#getPrefix().

    As Prefix encapsulates the prefix string that is also the return value
    of getPrefix(), overriding toString() in Prefix class to return the
    result of getPrefix() allows us to omit getPrefix() when concatenating
    prefixes to strings. e.g. PREFIX_PHONE + "911" would return the same
    value as PREFIX_PHONE.getPrefix() + "911".

    [#270] Set up workflow for asciidocs (#302)
    
    As discussed in fae87009249fc5a0084ea0d4fd28d1d8bf312921, we are
    migrating the documentation from GitHub Flavored Markdown to AsciiDoc.
    
    Let's teach Travis to generate HTML files with Asciidoctor using the
    AsciiDoc files inside the 'docs' directory. Generated files are then
    pushed to gh-pages branch for commits to the master branch.
    
    For the deploy script to work, maintainers will then have to:
     1. Create a GitHub machine account and grant it access to this repo
     2. Generate an access token and put it as an encrypted environment
         variable in Travis settings.
    
    We use personal access tokens instead of SSH deploy keys to grant
    Travis push access to the repo as they can be set up easily via GitHub's
    and Travis' websites, unlike SSH keys which require additional tools.
    
    However, personal access tokens grant access to all of a user's repos.
    If a user's access token is used, others with write access to the repo
    may change the deploy script to print the token and hence gain access to
    the user's repos. Thus, we create a separate GitHub user account
    (machine account) to handle deployment. This way, only the repo is put
    at risk in the case of a leak.
    
    Asciidoctor suggests using the Gradle Git Plugin to publish files to
    gh-pages[1]. However, setting up is more complicated and less
    customization is allowed.
    
    Travis also supports GitHub Pages Deployment[2]. However, it does not
    maintain history for generated files, storing only the most recent
    version, and the commit message cannot be customised to show which
    commit the files are generated from. This can be problematic if
    deployment fails as it is harder to identify which version of
    documentation is being deployed.
    
    In deploy_github_pages.sh, we use git credentials to store the personal
    access token instead of adding the token to the repo url. GitHub prints
    the repo url when there is an error for certain commands, so using
    credentials ensures that the token is not printed to Travis logs.

    [#319] Checkstyle: enforce separators' placement in line wraps (#368)
    
    Our coding standard for Java requires separators' placement in line
    wraps to follow specific rules, such as having comma (,) stay attached
    to the token that precedes it and having the dot (.) in a new line.
    These rules are not enforced by checkstyle.
    
    Let's teach Checkstyle to be stricter about line wrapping around some
    symbols by adding the relevant SeparatorWrap rules.

    [#319] Checkstyle: enforce final keyword or encapsulation for class variables (#364)
    
    Our coding standard for Java does not allow class variables to be
    declared public. This rule is not enforced by checkstyle.
    
    By not enforcing the rule, it violates the concept of Java information
    hiding and encapsulation. However, there is one exception to this
    rule, which is when the class is essentially a data structure, with no
    behaviour. In such cases the variables are required to use the
    final keyword to minimize unintended modifications to those
    variables by clients.
    
    Let's teach Checkstyle to enforce the above rule and its exception by
    adding the VisibilityModifier rule.

    [#293] Implement a IndexUtil#oneToZeroIndex() abstraction (#331)
    
    "i - 1" is sometimes used to convert 'i' from a one-based index to a
    zero-based index.
    
    Comments have to be added to describe the purpose of "i - 1", as it is
    not obvious whether we are taking the item before 'i', or whether we are
    converting 'i' from a one-based index into a zero-based index, which
    decreases code readability.
    
    Let's implement a IndexUtil#oneToZeroIndex(int) method which returns the
    zero-based index given the one-based index as input.
    
    The use of IndexUtil.oneToZeroIndex(int) removes the need for a comment
    when we convert 'i' from a one-based index to a zero-based index.

    Our coding standard requires @clauses in Javadoc comments

    @since, @serial, @serialField, @serialData, @deprecated
    This rule is not enforced by checkstyle.
    
    Keeping the order of at-clauses organized results in the javadocs
    being more readable in code form. This is important as this type of
    documentation is typically read more often inside the code than it is
    as processed text.
    
    Let's fix this by adding AtclauseOrder rule. It checks that the order
    of @clauses follows the tagOrder property value order.

    In cases where there are consecutive capital letters due to word
    boundaries around single-lettered words, such as in
    “canIHasReview”, we can make use of the allowedAbbreviations property to
    whitelist them. We are not relaxing the allowedAbbreviationLength to >1
    as single-lettered words are uncommon in identifier names, and
    whitelisting any legitimate cases is a suitable solution.

    [#310] Remove TestPerson (#373)
    
    TestPerson is used in testing to create a Person without filling in

    However, although it simplifies construction of a Person, it also

    its getTags() method doesn't return a deep copy.
    
    Let's remove TestPerson and use Person instead. With default fields,

    [#231] Simplify FXML files (#356)
    
    The FXML files are deeply nested with unnecessary parent elements.
    There are also multiple conflicting coding styles that exists within
    the same file.
    
    This makes the files hard to read and navigate. Furthermore, the
    differing coding styles in the same file makes the whole file
    inconsistent.
    
    Let's modify the FXML files as follows:
        * Change indentations to 2 spaces in all FXML files as these files
          tends to have deep nesting
        * Remove all star imports and reorder the rest in alphabetical
          order in all FXML files
        * Remove unnecessary parent elements to reduce the nesting in
          all FXML files
        * Remove all unnecessary CSS style sheet imports except those
          in MainWindow.fxml
        * Wrap long attributes into multiple lines and add white spaces
          in MainWindow.fxml to improve readability
        * Remove unneeded minwidth attribute in StatusBarFooter.fxml
        * Remove unnecessary HBox element in PersonListCard.fxml
        * Standardize inset attributes order declarations in all FXML files
        * Add a space before closing slash in self-closing tags in all FXML files

    [#342] Travis CI: cache dependencies (#347)
    
    Gradle dependencies are not cached in Travis builds.
    
    Consequently, the dependencies are re-downloaded in every build.
    
    Let's teach Travis to cache Gradle dependencies using the recommended
    configurations from Travis CI documentation [1].
    
    In our experiments, when cache is not enabled, it takes 26.68 seconds
    to run Gradle assemble task, which includes downloading Gradle and the
    dependencies. When cache is enabled, Travis will tar up all the cached
    directories and upload them to S3. So the cache is not network-local,
    and the download time will be bound to network bandwidth and DNS
    resolutions for S3. In the experiment, it takes 5.83 seconds to pull
    down the cache from S3 and another 10.75 seconds to finish the assemble
    task. At the end of the build, Travis will also check whether the cache
    is updated. If it is, Travis will create a new archive and upload it to
    S3. This check adds another 1.48 seconds overhead even when the cache
    is not updated. So a rough estimate is that the build time will be
    reduced by around 10 seconds when cache is enabled. Reasons for the
    shorter build time now may be because Travis downloads the dependencies
    from S3 in bulk instead of making multiple requests (one for each
    dependency).
    
    For more details on how caching works in Travis, please refer to [2].

          fully parsed Person object.
        * Make AddCommand's constructor accept a fully parsed
          ReadOnlyPerson.

    Remove the use of exceptions for control flow in AddCommandParser
    
    ArgumentsTokenzier throws a NoSuchElementException if an attempt is
    made to retrieve the value of a prefix that is not present or has an
    empty value. AddCommandParser interprets that exception as an invalid
    add command format. The flow of this check is hard to understand because
    it is embedded in a call to the AddCommand constructor and spills over to
    a catch block.
    
    The code will be easier to understand if there is an explicit prefix
    check before calling the constructor of AddCommand.
    
    Let's add an explicit check for empty prefixes and remove the use of
    NoSuchElementException to detect missing prefixes.

    [#312] ArgumentTokenizer: ensure tokenizing before getting values (#320)
    
    ArgumentTokenizer's tokenized arguments getters can be called before
    arguments have been tokenized with ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String).
    
    This is problematic as the getters would return empty Optionals, lists,
    and strings that are indistinguishable from normal empty results.
    
    Let's encapsulate ArgumentTokenizer's getters in ArgumentMultimap such
    that we can enforce the sequence of method calls and simplify
    ArgumentTokenizer's logic.

    ArgumentTokenizer: make tokenize(...) static
    
    Command parsers need to create a new ArgumentTokenizer object before
    they can tokenize an arguments string. During instantiation, the
    ArgumentTokenizer constructor is provided prefixes to be later used when
    ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String) is called.
    
    ArgumentTokenizer doesn't have a need to be instantiated before
    tokenizing can be done. The object is not reused to tokenize different
    arguments strings with the same set of prefixes provided during
    instantiation.
    
    Let's make ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(...) static, which also makes it
    state-independent and thus easier to test.

    ArgumentTokenizer's tokenized argument getters can be accessed even
    before ArgumentTokenizer is given arguments to tokenize through
    ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize(String).
    
    This behaviour is problematic as the getters can be called before

    [#336] Cannot add a label called `location` in person card (#339)
    
    JavaFX stores all the fields in a namespace map which maps the name of
    the field to the corresponding JavaFX object. JavaFX also defines some
    keys as a constant - in particular LOCATION_KEY as the String
    "location" and RESOURCES_KEY as the String "resources".
    
    Using any of these strings as a field will result in JavaFX trying to
    cast the field to the type of the corresponding value in the namespace.
    For example, any fields with the name "location" will be cast into an
    URL object which is not allowed.
    
    Let's document these findings down in the controller so as to inform
    other developers of the existence of such keywords.

    ERROR_STYLE_CLASS is appended, but when the successful command is
    entered, only one is removed, so at least one ERROR_STYLE_CLASS
    remains. Thus, the CommandBox shows the error style even though the
    latest command is successful.
    
    Let's teach CommandBox to add an ERROR_STYLE_CLASS for failed commands
    in CommandBox#setStyleToIndicateCommandFailure() only if the style
    class does not contain any. This ensures there is at most one
    ERROR_STYLE_CLASS at any point in time, so removing an
    ERROR_STYLE_CLASS for successful commands in
    CommandBox#setStyleToIndicateCommandSuccess() always works.

    [#301] Blank person cards should not have alternating colours (#304)
    
    Blank PersonCard are still created in the panel even though they have
    no content. Normal formatting such as alternate row colors still apply
    to these blank personcards. This can be easily observed by
    increasing the window size and performing a search that only returns
    one or two person cards.
    
    Let's remove the alternating row colors for blank person card cells.

    FindCommandParser: remove unnecessary regex usage
    
    CliSyntax#KEYWORDS_ARGS_FORMAT is a regex that greedily grabs one or
    more characters, excluding any leading or trailing whitespaces. It is
    used with String#trim() to check that a string contains at least one
    non-whitespace character.
    
    It is unnecessarily complex as the same task could be accomplished by
    just using simple String utility methods. String#trim() is sufficient in
    removing leading and trailing whitespaces, and in combination with
    String#isEmpty(), can perform the same check.
    
    Let's use String utility methods instead.

    ParserUtil#INDEX_ARGS_FORMAT is a regex that greedily grabs one or more

    check if a string is empty or contains at least one line terminator in
    between non-whitespace characters.

    StringUtil#isUnsignedInteger() encompasses the above checks and more.

    Styling is also possible using custom CSS stylesheets. Furthermore,

    Add Asciidoctor Gradle plugin
    
    GitHub Flavored Markdown does not support the specialized features that
    this project requires, such as use of colors and easy conversion to
    other file formats. AsciiDoc, like Markdown, uses a readable syntax
    that is easy to learn. It is also supported by GitHub preview. In

    AsciiDoc is designed to make it easy to translate documents to other
    formats, and Asciidoctor makes it simple for users to generate HTML
    files from asciidoc documents.
    
    Converting to PDF:
    
    While Asciidoctor supports conversion to PDF, Asciidoctor PDF is
    currently an alpha release and does not support useful features such as
    font colors. Styling must also be done separately in an Asciidoctor PDF
    theme file, which is different from the CSS used for HTML files.
    
    To convert documentation to PDF format, we suggest using the browser's
    'save as PDF' function on the generated HTML files instead.
    
    Stylesheets:
    
    asciidoctor.css is the default stylesheet by Asciidoctor and
    gh-pages.css is the customized version used by the documentation.
    Having our customizations in a separate file instead of editing the
    default stylesheet makes it easy for developers to swap in other
    stylesheets which import the default stylesheet, such as those available
    at https://github.com/darshandsoni/asciidoctor-skins.
    
    copyStylesheets Gradle task:
    
    Asciidoctor suggests using the resources method to copy additional
    resources (in this case, CSS stylesheets) to the build directory.
    However, this does not work as Asciidoctor tries to generate the
    HTML files before copying the resources, as discussed in
    https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin/issues/178.
    
    Let's create a copyStylesheets task to copy the necessary resources
    before running Asciidoctor instead, a workaround suggested in
    the issue mentioned above.
    
    Asciidoctor attributes:
    
    Even though all AsciiDoc files use the same images directory,
    imagesDir attribute must be set in each individual file instead of
    in Asciidoctor's attributes. Otherwise, GitHub preview wrongly
    links to image.png instead of images/image.png so images are not
    displayed in the preview.

    The person's fields classes (Phone, Email, Address, Name) are
    previously being tested indirectly by integration testing, through
    testing of the "Add" command, which happened to use these classes.
    
    Therefore, Add unit tests for them. By doing so, we  are able to test
    the validation code for these classes directly, and use inputs that
    were previously impossible to test in the integration testings (such
    as having a blank address with spaces: " ", which cannot be entered
    through the command box).

    Fix Name accepting blank names (spaces)
    
    The current regex allows space characters. However, this means that a
    string of whitespace characters (e.g. "         ") are permitted.
    
    Modify the regex such that blank strings (such as " ") are no longer
    allowed.
    
    An alternative would be to edit the validation function to check for
    the length of the trimmed string seperately (i.e. test.trim().length()
    == 0). However, that would not be elegant since we will now have two
    different things doing our validation (regex and the code checking
    length), which feels unnecessary compared to just using regex alone.

    the length of the trimmed string seperately (i.e. test.trim().length()
    == 0). However, that would not be elegant since we will now have two
    different things doing our validation (regex and the code checking the
    length), which feels unnecessary compared to just using regex alone.

    [#205] Reposition caret after an incorrect command  (#215)
    
    After an incorrect command is executed, the command box positions
    the caret at the beginning of the command.
    
    It is more intuitive if the caret remained in the same position as before.
    
    Retaining the caret at the same position after an incorrect command
    is harder than necessary because the Logic component uses events
    to notify other components of an incorrect command being executed.
    Exceptions are a more direct way to inform the caller the command
    is incorrect. Update Logic to use exceptions instead of events to handle
    incorrect commands. Update the command box to retain caret at the
    same position if the exception for an incorrect command is caught.

     [#276] checkstyle: fix module name error (#279)
    
    Several existing enabled modules in our Checkstyle configuration file,
    such as "TypeNameCheck" and "ConstantNameCheck", are being silently
    ignored by the Eclipse Checkstyle Plugin.
    
    This is because given a module "FooCheck", Checkstyle recognizes both
    its short name ("Foo") and its fully qualified name ("FooCheck") as
    names of that module. However, the Eclipse Checkstyle Plugin only uses
    short name convention, and thus does not recognize modules that are
    being referred to by their full names.
    
    Fix this by modifying our Checkstyle configuration file to use the short
    names of these modules, so that both Checkstyle and the Eclipse
    Checkstyle Plugin will recognize them.

    Add import order check in checkstyle
    
    This new checkstyle rule ensures consistent ordering of imports,
    following the rules that the default Eclipse formatter uses.
    That means Eclipse IDE users will not need to perform any additional
    configuration to adhere to these new import ordering rules.
    
    We chose Eclipse's default rules over the default rules of other IDEs
    because we are using Eclipse as the primary IDE for CS2103, SE-EDU
    and TEAMMATES at the moment. However, when the time comes to
    switch to another IDE, we will need to update the checkstyle rules
    accordingly.

     CollectionUtil: refactor assertNoNullElements -> isAnyNull(Collection)
    
    We refactor the method to return boolean instead of void, shifting the
    assertion responsibility outwards to wherever this method is called.
    Forcing the explicit usage of the 'assert' keyword thus making it clearer
    that an assertion is actually happening.
    
    We also overload this method with isAnyNull(Varargs) due to the
    similarities of both methods.

    CollectionUtil: fix assertNoNullElements bug
    
    assertNoNullElements isn't working as intended at all. The original
    intention of this method was to ensure each element of the given
    collection was non-null. However, by simply doing
    'assert !isAnyNull(Collection)', the collection is parsed as an Object,
    instead of an Object[]. Meaning it only checks if the collection
    reference is null rather than its actual elements.

    Check overloaded methods are grouped together in checkstyle
    
    This new checkstyle rule improves the readability of the code as it
    allows developers to see all the variations of a method at one place
    with no other code in between.
    
    However, note that there is a potential loophole in checkstyle
    OverloadMethodsDeclarationOrder module which permits out-of-order
    overloaded methods when they are separated by a nested class or
    interface.
    
    e.g. the following code in ModelManager.java will still pass the check,
    even though there is a nested interface between the two
    `updateFilteredPersonList()` method definitions:
    
        private void updateFilteredPersonList(Expression expression) {
            filteredPersons.setPredicate(expression::satisfies);
        }
    
        //========== Inner classes/interfaces ==================
        interface Expression {
            boolean satisfies(ReadOnlyPerson person);
            String toString();
        }
    
        public void updateFilteredPersonList(String keyword, boolean someRandomBool) {
            // do nothing

    Add UnusedImports check in checkstyle
    
    Unused imports are a code smell as they make it less clear which classes a
    Java file depends on. Our checkstyle configuration does not presently check
    for unused imports, so let's add an UsedImports check which does just that.
    
    There is already a slightly similarly-named check in our checkstyle.xml file
    called RedundantImport. Its name could mislead readers into thinking that it
    actually checks for unused imports as well, as an unused import could be
    considered to be "redundant". However, it doesn't actually do that. Because
    an import is redundant if
    1. It is a duplicate of another import.
    2. The class non-statically imported is from the java.lang package.
    3. The class non-statically imported is from the same package as the
       current package.

    Make Travis CI output less verbose
    
    Gradle utilises different levels for logging (see
    https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/logging.html).
    
    .travis.yml is set to execute gradle with '-i'. This means that log
    messages with 'INFO' level and above are printed to stdout, which is a
    more verbose level than the default.
    
    The reasons for using 'INFO' level are as follows:
    
      1. To ensure that the tests are actually running (instead of an empty
         Gradle task in its place).
    
      2. To determine which test stalled the CI (occasionally occurs due to
         either Travis issues or faulty tests).
    
    However, such detailed logging also generates a large quantity of
    logging information from non-test-runners, which pollutes the log and
    makes it extremely verbose without providing any additional useful
    diagnosis information for tests.
    
    As such, remove '-i' to disable 'INFO' logging level, and also modify
    build.gradle to ensure that the progress of the test runner is still
    being reported.

    UiPart: implement FXML loading constructor
    
    There's quite a lot of boilerplate involved if a developer wishes to
    implement a new UiPart. The developer needs to override:
    
    * `setNode()`
    
    * `getFxmlPath()`
    
    * potentially `setPlaceholder()`
    
    and think of what the sane thing is to do for each of these methods. In
    addition, to make the API pleasant to use, developers need to implement
    a static `load()` method. In that method, the developer needs to further
    decide which of the three overloaded `UiPartLoader::loadUiPart()`
    methods to call.
    
    The reason why so much boilerplate is required is because the current
    implementation, through `UiPartLoader`, places the responsibility of
    creating new `UiPart` instances (the controller) on the JavaFX
    FXMLLoader. However, FXMLLoader can only use the no-arg constructor of
    UiParts. As such, we need extra code to workaround this limitation in
    order to pass arguments into UiParts, leading to the above boilerplate
    code.
    
    To fix this problem, let's do two things:
    
    Firstly, we introduce a stricter definition of a UiPart: it contains a
    scene graph with a root node of a certain type T. This node can be
    retrieved with the new `getRoot()` getter.
    
    Secondly, we introduce new `UiPart(URL)` and `UiPart(String)`
    constructors. These UiPart constructors will construct the UiPart
    instance *first* before passing it to the FXMLLoader. In other words, we
    are now directly in control of our own constructors, which removes the
    need for the above boilerplate methods. A simple UiPart subclass would
    look like:
    
        public class NewUiPart extends UiPart<Pane> {
            private final Object arg;
    
            @FXML
            private TextBox myNode;
    
            public NewUiPart(Object arg) {
                super("NewUiPart.fxml");
    
                // We can now initialize final fields!
                this.arg = arg;
    
                // We can also access nodes in our FXML scene graph
                // immediately!
                myNode.setText("hello world!");
            }
        }
    
    Notice how short the code is, as well as how it does not need to
    implement a static `load()` method or depend on UiPartLoader.
    
    One problem is that FXMLLoader does not allow passing in a controller
    instance if the FXML file has a "fx:controller" attribute. Without this
    attribute, JavaFX FXML editors could potentially not be able to link the
    controller class with the FXML file[1], as they do not know what the
    controller class is. However, given the amount of code we save by
    adopting this architecture, this seems to be a worthwhile trade-off.
    
    There's lot of ui parts which currently depend on the old way of doing
    things, though. For now, let's mark the no-arg UiPart constructor, as
    well as the setNode(), getFxmlPath() and setPlaceholder() methods as
    deprecated. Convert setNode() and getFxmlPath() into non-abstract
    methods so that UiParts who have migrated over to the new API do not
    need to implement them.  Also, mark the UiPartLoader methods as
    deprecated since UiParts using the new API should not need to call them.
    
    In future commits, we will port each UiPart incrementally to use the new
    `UiPart(String)` constructor. When all code has been finally ported, we
    can then remove the deprecated code.
    
    While we are also here, let's add some tests for UiPart.
    
    [1] It should be noted, however, that Gluon Scene Builder (the usual
        FXML editor used by developers) does not actually link the FXML file
        with its controller class, so this commit may actually be a strict
        improvement with little drawbacks.

    Implement Travis CI trailing whitespace check
    
    While our checkstyle configuration already checks for trailing
    whitespace in our java files, it does not cover all text files in our
    repository. Notably: our documentation files and other configuration
    files such as `build.gradle`.
    
    While we could probably coax checkstyle and gradle to check for these
    files, it is much easier to just hook onto our existing "Travis CI
    checks" architecture to implement this check.
    
    Trailing whitespace should be considered an error, however we treat
    trailing whitespace in markdown (`*.md`) files as warnings instead to
    accomodate developers who prefer to edit documentation using the GitHub
    web interface which does not provide facilities to easily detect and
    remove trailing whitespace.

    Implement Travis CI line ending checks
    
    In our repository, we want:
    
    * All text files to use only LF ('\n') as their line endings. Not CRLF
      ('\r\n')
    
    * All text files to end with a newline (Newline at EOF).
    
    So, ideally, we should have checks that automatically check for these
    requirements in our repository.
    
    However, we can't impose these checks on all developers, namely Windows
    developers. They could be using either LF or CRLF (e.g. if the developer
    activated Git's core.autocrlf configuration). Even if we did, we can't
    guarantee that developers do not bypass these checks. As such, we have
    to implement these checks on the Travis CI level instead.
    
    The next question is how do we implement these checks. Checkstyle is
    already helping us with that, but it is not completely effective as it
    does not check *all* text files -- it only checks the source files which
    are used for compilation.  This means that it does not check things like
    resource files (CSS and FXML files), test data and documentation.
    
    While we could probably teach it to check all files, we meet another
    problem; Checkstyle does not know what a text file is. At best, we can
    only give it a filter of file extensions to check.
    
    On the other hand, Git knows the difference between text files and
    binary files. As such, let's implement some shell scripts that will use
    Git's facilities to implement our line ending checks on all text files.
    These checks will be run on Travis CI, thus guaranteeing that master
    will not have any more line ending problems.
    
    These checks are implemented in POSIX shell scripts so that Travis CI
    would not need to download any additional dependencies in order to run
    them. Furthermore, developers running Linux or Macs can also run them
    locally without downloading additional dependencies as well. Windows
    devs would be unable to run them, but then again these line ending
    checks are not useful to them because as mentioned above, Windows devs
    may be using CRLF line endings anyway.

    [#190] Make ReadOnlyAddressBook truly read-only (#199)
    
    * Remove redundant "get empty address book" methods
    
    It seems strange that we have AddressBook#getEmptyAddressBook() and
    TestUtil#generateEmptyAddressBook() methods, when a simple
    `new AddressBook()` will give us what we want.
    
    * Fully encapsulate UniquePersonList and UniqueTagList within AddressBook
    
    ReadOnlyAddressBook declares the following methods:
    
    * `UniqueTagList getUniqueTagList();`
    
    * `List<Tag> getTagList();`
    
    * `UniquePersonList getUniquePersonList();`
    
    * `List<ReadOnlyPerson> getPersonList();`
    
    As we can see, there is some redundancy; both `getUniqueTagList()` and
    `getTagList()` conceptually do the same thing, and both
    `getUniquePersonList()` and `getPersonList()` conceptually do
    the same thing as well.
    
    So, to simplify the API we need to pick one set of APIs: either the ones
    that return `UniqueXList`, or the ones that return `List<X>`.
    
    Going with the API that returns `List<X>` is more beneficial than
    `UniqueXList`: Lists are widely used throughout our code and the
    standard library, and thus returning a list would be much more
    convenient for developers. `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueTagList`, on
    the other hand, only implement the `Iterable` interface, and are thus
    slightly more annoying to write code with.
    
    However, there is a deeper problem as well: `UniquePersonList` and
    `UniqueTagList` both contain mutating methods, which violates the
    contract of `ReadOnlyAddressBook` to provide a read-only view to the
    address book. We could solve this by introducing
    `ReadOnlyUniquePersonList` and `ReadOnlyUniqueTagList` interfaces, but
    as argued above, by virtue of not implementing the `List`
    interface these objects are more annoying to deal with and thus it is
    likely better to not return them at all.
    
    As such, this commit removes the `getUniqueTagList()` and
    `getUniquePersonList()` methods. In addition, we also remove all of the
    methods of `AddressBook` that take a `UniquePersonList` or
    `UniqueTagList`, thus fully encapsulating these classes within
    `AddressBook`. This not only solves the contract violation problem as
    discussed above, it also reduces coupling as users will no longer need
    to depend directly on `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueTagList` any more.
    
    * ModelManager: merge two similar constructors
    
    Both ModelManager(AddressBook, UserPrefs) and
    ModelManager(ReadOnlyAddressBook, UserPrefs) both do exactly the same
    thing. Let's DRY up the code by merging them into one single
    constructor.
    
    The author notes that the `userPrefs` argument is currently not even
    used. However, fixing this is outside the scope of this commit.
    
    * AddressBook: replace getPersons() with getPersonList()
    
    ReadOnlyAddressBook has a getPersonList() method which returns its list
    of persons as a List<ReadOnlyPerson>
    
    AddressBook has a getPersons() method which returns its list of persons
    as an ObservableList<Person>.
    
    Simplify the API by merging these methods together, by making
    getPersonList() return an ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson> and removing
    getPersons().
    
    * ReadOnlyAddressBook: make getTagList() return an ObservableList
    
    Even though there are currently no callers that require the return value
    to be an ObservableList, this is still done for consistency with
    getPersonList() and to make it easier to implement future UI features
    such as a listing of all tags.
    
    * fixup! Fully encapsulate UniquePersonList and UniqueTagList within AddressBook
    
    * fixup! Fully encapsulate UniquePersonList and UniqueTagList within AddressBook

    [#221] Rework how TypicalTestPersons exposes its persons (#224)
    
    * TypicalTestPersons: remove repetition of typical persons list
    
    The list of typical persons is repeated in
    loadAddressBookWithSampleData() and getTypicalPersons(). DRY up the code
    by making getTypicalPersons() the authoritative source.
    
    * TypicalTestPersons: make TestPerson fields non-static
    
    Throughout the code base, TypicalTestPersons is typically used in the
    following fashion so that tests can access the test persons using a
    shorter variable name, e.g.:
    
        TypicalTestPersons td = new TypicalTestPersons();
        td.alice, td.benson etc.
    
    However, with such code, Eclipse will give the following warning:
    
        The static field TypicalTestPersons.alice should be accessed in a
        static way.
    
    This is because these TestPerson fields are static. This is problematic
    because these fields can be accessed without first constructing a
    TypicalTestPersons object (e.g. with `TypicalTestPersons.alice`,
    `TypicalTestPersons.benson` etc.), which could potentially lead to
    NullPointerExceptions (if a TypicalTestPersons object was not
    constructed yet) or state leaks (if a test modifies the TestPersons)
    which are hard to debug.
    
    As such, let's make these TestPerson fields non-static.

    [#192] Set Up AppVeyor CI (#218)
    
    AppVeyor[1] is a continuous integration service used to build and test
    projects on a Windows VM. Adding AppVeyor support to this project will
    allow us to easily ensure that our tests do not break on Windows.
    
    Add an appveyor.yml file that will teach AppVeyor how to build this
    project and run its tests.
    
    Update our documentation to explain to developers how to set up AppVeyor
    on their own repositories.
    
    For now, we will run our tests with 64-bit Java only, since the project
    does not use any native libraries and thus is unlikely to have any
    architecture-specific bugs. In the future, should we use any native
    libraries, the appveyor.yml file should be updated to run our tests on
    both 32-bit and 64-bit Java.

    [#186] Construct BrowserPanel in FXML (#208)
    
    * Construct BrowserPanel using FXML
    
    The DeveloperGuide states that the layout of individual UiParts are
    specified in matching `.fxml` files. e.g. The layout of
    `MainWindow.java` is specified in `MainWindow.fxml`.
    
    While this is true for almost all UiParts, there is one oddball UiPart
    that does not have a corresponding `.fxml` file -- BrowserPanel.
    
    For consistency with the rest of the UiParts, let's construct the
    BrowserPanel using FXML rather than using code.
    
    * Remove DefaultBrowserPlaceHolderScreen.fxml
    
    It is not being used at all.

    checkstyle: ensure curly brackets have whitespace around them #181 (#182)
    
    * codestyle: ensure curly brackets are separated by whitespace
    
    The Java coding standard[1] requires that curly brackets ({}) be
    surrounded by whitespace.
    
    However, there are several violations of this requirement in the code
    base. e.g.
    
        protected void raise(BaseEvent event){
        -------------------------------------^
                            Space required before '{'
    
    Fix all of these code style violations.
    
    [1] https://oss-generic.github.io/process/codingstandards/coding-standards-java.html#methods
    
    * checkstyle: ensure curly brackets have whitespace around them
    
    There used to be methods in the code base where the curly brackets ({})
    are not separated by whitespace:
    
        protected void raise(BaseEvent event){
        -------------------------------------^
                            Space required before '{'
    
    Our checkstyle configuration failed to catch these errors because we did
    not tell checkstyle to check for the LCURLY, RCURLY and SLIST (statement
    list) tokens. Fix this in the checkstyle config file so that such code
    style violations will not happen again.

        ...etc
    
    This goes on for every single Java file.
    
    This is because this repo's files uses LF as the line separator.
    However, the default "lineSeparator" value of the "NewlineAtEndOfFile"
    check is CRLF on Windows[1], hence these errors.
    
    One may argue that we could switch on `core.autocrlf` in Git, which
    would tell Git to automatically convert all LF line endings to CRLF,
    thus avoiding this problem. However, this not only places an additional
    burden on Windows users to configure Git properly, it also does not
    handle the use cases where a developer is not using Git. The developer
    may, for example, instead get hold of the repo by downloading the ZIP
    file using Github's "Download as ZIP"[2] functionality, and will thus
    still have this problem as the downloaded ZIP contents will still
    contain LF line endings.
    
    Thus, we should either switch the "lineSeparator" property to "lf",
    accepting only LF line endings, or "lf_cr_crlf", accepting LF, CR or
    CRLF line endings. (Checkstyle does not support just LF and CRLF only)
    
    However, some developers may have `core.autocrlf` accidentally set, or
    may even prefer to use CRLF line endings in their working copy. As such,
    let's go the route of allowing LF, CR or CRLF as line endings.

    [188] Construct StatusBarFooter in FXML fully
    
    StatusBarFooter currently constructs and sets up its StatusBar controls
    using pure code.
    
    The StatusBar control is actually a real control that can be initialized
    directly in the FXML file. We can avoid placeholder elements and make
    things simpler by just doing that.
    
    Now, one may think: "This means Scene Builder cannot edit this FXML file
    any more!", since the StatusBar control comes from controlsfx, which is
    not supported by Scene Builder by default. However,
    
    1. Scene Builder can actually be configured[1] to support the custom
       controls from controlsfx, allowing it to edit the FXML file.
    
    2. Having too many placeholder nodes, and constructing the actual scene
       graph in code, kind of defeats the advantage of FXML which is to
       construct the scene graph declaratively without code.

    build.gradle: add `run` and `runShadow` tasks (#178)
    
    The `run` and `runShadow` tasks provide a convenient way for developers
    to run the built application from its *.class files or the built fat JAR
    respectively.
    
    This is accomplished using the application plugin[1] which implements
    the 'run' task.
    
    The shadow plugin, which we already use, will automatically detect the
    `application` plugin and will integrate with it[2], providing the
    `runShadow` task. It also knows that `mainClassName` should be used
    as the "Main-Class" of the JAR manifest, so we don't need to specify
    that anymore.
    
    We add the `mainClassName` and `plugin` lines OUTSIDE of the
    `allprojects` block because the question of "which class should be run"
    is Gradle project-specific and only applicable to the root project.

    [183] UiParts should not store a reference to the primaryStage
    
    * UiPart: move setIcon() into MainWindow
    
    UiPart::setIcon() is only used by MainWindow. Furthermore, UiParts
    should not be allowed to change the primary stage's icon at their whim
    and fancy, as it may lead to multiple UiParts conflicting with each
    other because they all want to set the primary stage's icons.
    
    So, make it clear that only MainWindow is allowed to do this by moving
    UiPart::setIcon() into MainWindow, and making it private.
    
    * UiPart: move setIcon() into FxViewUtil
    
    UiPart::setIcon() does not depend on any internal data of UiPart, and
    thus is better suited to be in an external utility class as a static
    method. This is done to make it clear that calling setIcon() will not
    modify the state of any objects, besides the Stage passed in as an
    argument.
    
    * FxViewUtil: rename setIcon() to setStageIcon()
    
    This is done to make it clear that the method operates on a Stage.
    
    * UiPart: push down primaryStage
    
    Currently, all UiParts store a reference to their primaryStage, which
    means that they can modify the primaryStage at their own whim and fancy.
    
    We want to prevent that -- UiParts should not be able to access the
    primaryStage as it makes it hard to reason about which UiPart is
    controlling the primaryStage and which is not. As such, we want to
    remove the reference to the primaryStage from all UiParts.
    
    Of all the UiParts, we note that only MainWindow requires a reference to
    the primaryStage. All other UiParts do not, and SHOULD NOT, keep a
    reference to the primaryStage.
    
    So, we push down the `primaryStage` field from UiPart to MainWindow
    only. All other UiParts thus effectively lose access to the
    primaryStage, which is a good thing for encapsulation.
    
    * UiPartLoader: rename loadUiPart() to initUiPart()
    
    All other variants of loadUiPart() will reconstruct the UiPart based on
    the value of "fx:controller" in its FXML file.
    
    Only loadUiPart(T seedUiPart) does not -- it simply sets up the FXML
    scene graph using the existing UiPart object provided.
    
    To highlight the difference in behaviour of this method from the others,
    rename this method to `initUiPart()`.
    
    * UiPartLoader: add single argument variant of loadUiPart()
